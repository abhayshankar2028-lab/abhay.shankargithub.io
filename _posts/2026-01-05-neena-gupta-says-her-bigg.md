Neena Gupta's recent statement about the film Saath Saath has left us contemplative. The actress revealed that the biggest mistake she made during her career was opting for the lead role in Saath Saath. According to Neena, the film, which showcased her as an independent heroine, took away the spotlight she initially deserved. She expressed regret over taking on a leading role and felt it overshadowed her chances of becoming a leading lady in Bollywood. This revelation highlights the importance of being selective with one's projects and taking the time to grow and develop as an artist. Neena's words serve as a cautionary tale for aspiring actors, emphasizing the value of patience, hard work, and strategic decisions in achieving success in the film industry.
