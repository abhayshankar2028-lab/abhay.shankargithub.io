Renowned Bollywood actress Neena Gupta recently opened up about her most pivotal role, 'Saath Saath'. She candidly shares that the film was her biggest mistake - stating that it took away her chance to establish herself as a heroine. The 1997 romantic drama, starring Neena alongside Aamir Khan, catapulted her to stardom. However, her subsequent projects did not quite match the commercial success of 'Saath Saath'. Neena attributes this to the film's overwhelming market share and the subsequent lack of recognition she received for her portrayal of Kamalika, a character that showcased her acting skills.

Neena's honest revelation has sparked a conversation about the power of commercial success in Bollywood and the importance of standing out as a heroine. 'Saath Saath' remains a landmark film in Neena's career, and she has come to terms with its lasting impact on her career.
