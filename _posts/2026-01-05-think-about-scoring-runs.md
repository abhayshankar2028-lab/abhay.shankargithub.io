**Unlocking Victory: Ricky Ponting's Advice to Suryakumar Yadav**

In India's T20 history, few batsmen have risen to the challenge of scoring runs without succumbing to the inevitable setbacks. Suryakumar Yadav's impressive form in the tournament stands as a testament to his dedication and mental toughness. When asked about his approach, former Australian skipper Ricky Ponting shared valuable insights.

"Think about scoring runs and not getting out," Ponting advised. "It's not just about being present, but also about being focused. Every shot, every moment counts. The most important thing is to stay calm, analyze the situation, and trust your instincts. If you're caught or run out, don't worry, just pick yourself up and try again. The key is to stay in the moment and not let pressure get to you." By incorporating these mental strategies, Yadav has been able to defy expectations and secure crucial victories for India.
