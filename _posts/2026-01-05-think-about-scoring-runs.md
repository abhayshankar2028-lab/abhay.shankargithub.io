**Score or Suryakumar: Ricky Ponting's Advice for India T20 Skipper**

In an exclusive conversation with ESPN Cricinfo, former Australian captain Ricky Ponting shared his advice for India T20 skipper Suryakumar Yadav. When asked about his strategy for preventing pressure and staying focused in high-pressure situations, Ponting emphasized the importance of staying in the moment and not letting emotions dictate the game.

"Your run-rate is not just about scoring runs, it's also about not getting out," Ponting said. "When you're playing for a team, you've got to be able to manage your run-rate without thinking about your run-rate. It's not about being a 'keeper' or a 'batsman,' it's about being a competitor." Ponting also stressed the need for mental toughness, reminding the young captain that a single mistake can change the course of the game.
