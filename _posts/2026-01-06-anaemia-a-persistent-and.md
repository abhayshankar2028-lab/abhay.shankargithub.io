**The Silent Killer in Women's Cricket: Anaemia**

As a nutritionist who's worked closely with Indian cricketers like Harmanpreet Kaur and Smriti Mandhana, I've seen firsthand the devastating impact of anaemia on their performance and overall well-being. Anaemia, a condition characterized by low red blood cell count, can lead to fatigue, dizziness, and even sudden death. In women's cricket, anaemia is particularly prevalent due to hormonal fluctuations, increased blood loss, and inadequate iron intake.

Studies have shown that cricketers are at a higher risk of anaemia due to factors such as menstrual bleeding, iron deficiency, and gastrointestinal disorders. I've worked with players to develop personalized nutrition plans, incorporating iron-rich foods, vitamin C-rich fruits, and other essential nutrients to help alleviate anaemia symptoms. By addressing this pressing issue, we can help our cricketers perform at their best and reach new heights of success.
