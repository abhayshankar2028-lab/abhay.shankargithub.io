**"Family is dead in Bollywood": Zarina Wahab on choosing Telugu films**

In a recent conversation, Zarina Wahab opened up about her feelings towards the state of Bollywood, specifically the trend of choosing high-profile Telugu films over smaller-scale projects. "Family is dead in Bollywood," she said, highlighting the focus on big-budget movies. The actress, who has worked with prominent filmmakers like Ram Gopal Varma, emphasized that she prefers smaller-scale projects.

Wahab's thoughts on Telugu films sparked a lively discussion among fans and critics. While some praised her for taking risks, others felt that she was compromising her career by prioritizing one language over another. Boman Irani, a seasoned actor with a long list of Bollywood hits, added his two cents, stating that Prabhas, the star of "The Raja Saab," was "unlike a superstar" – a comment that sparked a heated debate about the state of the industry.
