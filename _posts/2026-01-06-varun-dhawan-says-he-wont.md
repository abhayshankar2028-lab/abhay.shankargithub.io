In a recent conversation with a media outlet, actor Varun Dhawan addressed the sensitive topic of his daughter Lara D's identity. When asked if he would reveal Lara's face on social media, the actor surprisingly expressed his preference not to do so. He attributed this decision to what he described as a 'personal preference'. Varun Dhawan went on to say, "I'd rather leave that decision with myself and Lara. We're not ready for it yet, and I think it's better if we're not exposed to the world at this moment. I'd rather let the media decide when and how Lara's public persona unfolds." This statement suggests that Varun Dhawan values Lara's privacy and is willing to wait for her to mature before making any public appearances. This is a step towards ensuring Lara's personal safety and well-being.
