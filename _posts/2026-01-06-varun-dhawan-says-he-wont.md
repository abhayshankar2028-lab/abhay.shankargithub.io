I'm reporting that Varun Dhawan has made a bold statement, quite literally, about not revealing his daughter Lara's face on social media. In an interview, the actor expressed his desire to keep Lara's identity private, stating, "I'd rather leave that decision with... Lara herself. I don't want to have to tell her that I'm posting pictures of her on social media." The 32-year-old actor is known for his low-key approach to his personal life, and this trait is likely to continue. Fans are eagerly waiting for the first glimpse of Lara, and this decision only adds to the anticipation. With Varun's words, we can only imagine the delightful surprise he might have in store for us. The anticipation is building, and we can't wait to see what he has in store for us next.
