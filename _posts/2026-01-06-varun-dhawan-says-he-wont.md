In a recent statement, Bollywood superstar Varun Dhawan has emphasized his commitment to keeping his daughter Lara's identity on the down low. The actor revealed that he plans to keep his daughter's face a secret on social media, citing his desire to maintain her anonymity. According to Varun, he'd rather leave the decision of whether to reveal Lara's face to the public with others instead. He emphasized that his primary priority is Lara's protection and privacy. "I'd rather leave that decision with...the people who care about her the most," he expressed. This stance stems from Varun's concern for Lara's safety and well-being. By keeping her identity hidden, he hopes to ensure her safety and allow her to develop a sense of security in her personal and professional life. This approach is likely to put Lara in a safe environment.
