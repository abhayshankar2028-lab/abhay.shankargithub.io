**Bangladesh's T20 World Cup Contingent Leaves Door Open**

In a latest move, Bangladesh cricket team's director general, Shamsuddin Ahmed, has expressed optimism that the team might travel to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup. The Director-General stated that the team's preparations are on track, and they are working diligently to secure a spot in the tournament. While there's no official confirmation from the BCCI, the dynamics of the team's selection process suggest that Bangladesh might secure a spot in the T20 World Cup. The team has been in good form, with recent performances in the Asia Cup and the Asia Cup Super Four. With a strong squad and a solid coaching team, Bangladesh is a team to watch out for in the tournament. It remains to be seen whether the team will head to India for the T20 World Cup, but for now, the door remains open.
