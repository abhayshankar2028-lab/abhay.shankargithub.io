**ICC Delays Bangladesh's T20 World Cup Match Request**

In a shocking turn of events, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has declined a request from Bangladesh to move the country's T20 World Cup matches from India. The Bangladesh Cricket Board had requested the ICC to shift the matches from the Indian government's insistence on hosting the tournament in the country. However, the ICC ultimately decided to stick with its original plan to host the tournament in India.

As a result, the T20 World Cup is set to continue in India, with the Indian capital hosting key matches and tournaments throughout the tournament. This move has been met with disappointment for Bangladesh, who are eager to host the tournament in their own country. The decision has been welcomed by the Indian government, which has promised to provide all necessary infrastructure and support to host the tournament successfully.
