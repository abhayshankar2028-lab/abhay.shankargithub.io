Ikkis, the highly-anticipated Bollywood film starring Dhurandhar, has hit the 25 crore mark, but it's not in awe of the Dhurandhar wave. In a fascinating display of resilience, Ikkis has managed to defy the trends and keep its box office numbers ticking. Although it's been five days since its release, Ikkis has garnered an impressive total of 25.15 crores. The film's success can be attributed to the massive star power of Dhurandhar, which has undoubtedly generated a lot of buzz. However, the slow pace of Ikkis is a concern, as the Dhurandhar wave seems to be swinging against it. Despite this, Ikkis still holds up as a promising debut, with its storyline, music, and performances captivating audiences. While it may not be at the top of the box office charts, Ikkis is indeed a movie worth watching.
