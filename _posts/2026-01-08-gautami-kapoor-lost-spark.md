**Gautami Kapoor Opens Up On Fading Spark**

In a recent interview, Gautami Kapoor shared a poignant account of how her husband Ram Kapoor's joblessness and subsequent financial struggles affected their marriage. During that tumultuous period, Gautami reportedly earned thrice her husband's salary while he was jobless. This diaphragmatic experience left a deep impression on her.

"Gautami was earning about 3-4 lakhs every month, while I was only getting 1-2 lakhs," she recounted. "It was as if the financial disparity between us was driving a wedge in our relationship." Despite sharing this painful memory with the world, Gautami expressed forgiveness for Ram's mistakes and a desire to move forward.

It's evident that Gautami's experience with her husband's joblessness has left a lasting impact on their marriage, but it also underscores the importance of forgiveness and understanding in relationships.
