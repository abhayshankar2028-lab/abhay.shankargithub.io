**ICC WTC Points Table 2025-27 Update: Australia Dominates Standings**

The ICC World Test Championship Points Table updates were released earlier today, reflecting the current standings going into the 2025-27 format. In a testament to their dominance, Australia has been at the top of the table for the fourth consecutive year. Australia secured a historic 4-1 Ashes victory over England, ending England's hopes of regaining the title. This win has catapulted Australia to the top spot, with 172 points. England, who have been trailing by seven points, will need to bounce back with a strong performance in their remaining two Tests to catch up. Australia's Ashes haul now stands at 163, leaving England to trail behind with 156 points. The ICC World Test Championship returns to its traditional two-year cycle from 2028 onwards, with the next edition taking place from 2028 to 2030.
