I have some breaking news in the world of Bollywood. The talented actress Khushboo Sundar recently revealed how intense her experience was working on the film Dhurandhar, directed by Akshaye Khanna. In a candid interview, Khushboo shared how she felt 'loved to hate' her co-star Akshaye Khanna. Apparently, the dynamic duo had distinct on-screen personas, with Akshaye playing a typical everyman character while Khushboo portrayed a more complex and powerful character. The contrast between their performances created a compelling dynamic, making the film stand out. Khushboo also gushed about the scenes where Akshaye shared his emotional side, describing them as 'intense and cathartic'. It seems that despite their differences, they clearly understood how to bring out the best in each other.
