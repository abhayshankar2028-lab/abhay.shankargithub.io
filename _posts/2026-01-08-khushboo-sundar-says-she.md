In the 1996 classic 'Dhurandhar', the talented actress Khushboo Sundar not only stole the show with her electrifying performances, but also left viewers intrigued by her on-screen persona. However, her most memorable line remains 'loved to hate Akshaye Khanna'. The reason behind this infamous line lies in the character of Akshaye, played by none other than the legendary Akshaye Khanna himself. The iconic actor, known for his powerful presence on screen, portrays a character who is both a loving father and a father figure to his son. Khushboo's line, which is a subtle yet powerful commentary on their complex family dynamics, showcases her impressive acting chops. The line has since become an iconic moment in Bollywood, symbolizing the challenges of balancing love and duty.
