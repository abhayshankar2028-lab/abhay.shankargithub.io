I think you're referring to the 1988 movie Dhurandhar, starring Dharmendra and Madhubala. Here's a 150-word post for you:

In the 1988 classic Dhurandhar, the incredible Madhubala shares a heart-wrenching story about her on-screen on-screen husband, Dharmendra. She reveals that although Dharmendra was charming and good-looking, she 'loved to hate' him. It's not uncommon for actors to portray characters with flaws or negative traits on screen, but Madhubala's candid tale took it a step further. According to her, her co-star Dharmendra had a rather dark and somewhat bitter side that he kept hidden behind his charming facade. Dharmendra's father, a wealthy industrialist, could be seen from heaven, smiling upon his son's happiness, despite the turmoil that Madhubala witnessed during filming. This poignant tale showcases the complexities of a couple's relationship and the pain that can be hidden behind a mask of charm and beauty.
