Aakash Chopra recently weighed in on the recent IND vs NZ T20I series, where Tilak Varma was replaced by Shreyas Iyer for the final match. Chopra questioned the decision to drop Varma, suggesting that Iyer would have been the better choice. Chopra wondered why Varma was replaced by Iyer, a player known for his batting skills. Chopra also suggested that Sarpanch, a term often used to describe a close-knit team captain, should be chosen automatically for future T20I series. Chopra's reasoning is that such a captain would possess the necessary leadership qualities and tactical acumen to lead the team effectively. Chopra believes that Iyer, with his impressive batting record and experience playing against top-tier teams, would be the ideal choice for the role.
