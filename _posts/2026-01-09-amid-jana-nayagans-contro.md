In a recent statement, renowned film director Ram Gopal Varma has expressed his discontent with the Indian Censor Board's (CCB) outdated guidelines. It appears that the CCB has once again created a regulatory mess that stifles artistic expression and hinders creative freedom. The director's sentiments were highlighted during the controversy surrounding Jana Nayagan, a prominent Indian film director who recently received the India's National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for his work on the song "Vijay" from the movie Sanju.

Variety outlets have reported that Varma has stated, "The CCB is outdated. It insults viewers." It seems like Ram Gopal Varma believes the CCB is no longer relevant in today's cinematic landscape. He thinks the guidelines should be revised to promote artistic freedom and allow filmmakers to push boundaries while still adhering to the expected standards.
