In the midst of Jana Nayagan's provocative controversy, Bollywood's most influential producer Ram Gopal Varma has weighed in. While Jana Nayagan is indeed facing heat over his alleged remarks, it seems Varma has a different perspective on the matter. In an interview, Varma stated that the Censor Board is "outdated" and "insults viewers." This unexpected stance raises questions about the role of the Censor Board in regulating the industry. By questioning the authority of the Censor Board, Varma may be suggesting that his work is not limited to what the board deems acceptable. It's worth noting that Varma has produced a wide range of films, from Gangster to Bhabhi Noorani, and his diverse portfolio might be challenging the notion that the Censor Board is solely responsible for his content.
