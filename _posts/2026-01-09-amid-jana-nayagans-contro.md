**Censor Board's Timeless Issues Still Resonate in Bollywood Today**

In the midst of controversy surrounding Amid Jana Nayagan's film, Ram Gopal Varma recently expressed his thoughts on the current state of India's film censorship board, stating that it is "outdated" and "insulting" to viewers. Varma's statement highlights the persistent debate surrounding the powers granted to the Censor Board, which has been in place since 1972. Critics argue that the board's strict regulations stifle creativity and limit artistic freedom, while proponents claim that it serves as a safeguard for public morals. Despite the Censor Board's continued presence, its role has evolved, and the industry now acknowledges that some artistic expression is necessary to push boundaries. Varma's remarks underscore the ongoing need for a nuanced approach to regulating film content in India.
