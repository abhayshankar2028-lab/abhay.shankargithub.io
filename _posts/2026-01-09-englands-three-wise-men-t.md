I'm Geoffrey Boycott, renowned English cricket commentator. In a recent interview, I expressed my frustration with the notion that England's 3W (wicket-keeping) trio, comprising Andrew Flintoff, Michael Holding, and Stephen Taylor, are the same three 'wise men' as the legendary trio of Wisden Cricketers' editor, Arthur Winterton, Sir Donald Bradman, and Sir Don Bradman.

While I respect their skill, I firmly believe that the trio's exceptional ability is more a product of their individual talents rather than their collective wisdom. I echo the argument that the three stooges have been overshadowed by the likes of Wisden Cricketers' editors who provided guidance and insight before their time. I implore the cricket world to recognize their remarkable accomplishments without diminishing their contributions to the game.
