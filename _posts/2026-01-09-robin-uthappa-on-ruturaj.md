**Robin Uthappa on Ruturaj Gaikwad: 'In Indian cricket, it is important to strike when the iron is hot'**

In an exclusive interview with ESPN Cricinfo, former Indian opener Robin Uthappa opened up about his thoughts on Ruturaj Gaikwad's impressive performances in the current Indian Premier League (IPL). The duo has been putting up impressive performances, with Gaikwad's batting prowess defying expectations. Uthappa praised Gaikwad's ability to stay calm under pressure and capitalize on scoring opportunities.

While the duo's partnership has been crucial in India's IPL campaign, Uthappa emphasized the importance of being smart with the bat and taking wickets when possible. "In Indian cricket, it is essential to strike when the iron is hot," Uthappa said. "Guys like Ruturaj, who can do that, are invaluable to the team." Uthappa's words serve as a reminder that in Indian cricket, it's not just about having a talented batter, but also about being a skilled one who can deliver when it matters most.
