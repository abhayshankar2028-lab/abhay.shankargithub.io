In a recent interview, former Indian cricketer Robin Uthappa was asked about Virat Kohli's test retirement. When asked about his thoughts, Uthappa expressed admiration for Kohli, stating that the latter's eyes convey a deep sense of emotional intensity. Uthappa detailed Kohli's ability to convey unspoken feelings through his eyes, a quality that Uthappa himself possesses.

Uthappa argued that Kohli's eyes naturally convey a story that transcends words, and that it's essential to listen and understand the emotional depth behind his expressions. He emphasized the importance of Kohli's test retirement and suggested that it be rescinded. Uthappa suggested that Kohli's passion and dedication to the sport should be acknowledged and celebrated. The sentiment is clear: Kohli's eyes speak volumes, and a rescinded retirement would be a loss for Indian cricket.
