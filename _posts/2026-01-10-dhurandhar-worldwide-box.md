**Dhurandhar Worldwide Box Office Collection Day 36: A Mixed Bag for Bollywood**

The highly anticipated Ranveer Singh-starrer, Dhurandhar Worldwide, witnessed a rollercoaster ride of ticket sales on its 36th day in theaters. While it initially struggled with a relatively low opening day, the movie managed to turn the tables on its competitors on the sixth day.

Notably, Dhurandhar has far surpassed its opening day collection, reaching Rs. 7.5 crore on the sixth day, which is a significant jump. The movie now stands at a respectable Rs. 25.5 crore. In contrast, Haq, a critically acclaimed drama starring Akshay Kumar, opened with a substantial collection of Rs. 7.1 crore and is still performing well.

Bengal Files, a family drama directed by Vishnuvardhan, has also been performing quite well, albeit at a slower pace. Overall, it seems that Dhurandhar is currently holding a strong position in box office charts, with its collection showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon.
