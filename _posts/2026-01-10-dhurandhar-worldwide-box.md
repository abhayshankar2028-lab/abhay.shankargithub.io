Ranveer Singh-starrer Dhurandhar Worldwide has finally hit the floor, and it's been a mixed bag for the Bollywood superstar. As per reports, Dhurandhar Worldwide Box Office Collection Day 36 (Friday, December 1, 2023) has earned around ₹25 crore, with an opening weekend of ₹7.5 crore. In comparison, the film managed to collect over ₹10 crore in its initial weekend. However, the film's box office performance seems to be a mixed bag, with some scenes seeing a higher earnings than others. On the other hand, the film's lower earnings on its lowest earning day of Friday, December 1, 2023, at ₹1.5 crore, might help it catch up with some of its competitors like Haq and Bengal Files. Despite not being the highest-grossing film, Dhurandhar Worldwide is certainly a decent performance for the actor.
