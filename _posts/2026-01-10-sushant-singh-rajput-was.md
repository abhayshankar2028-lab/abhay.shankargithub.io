**Bollywood Brings Together Two Hilarious Debates: Sushant Singh Rajput vs Bandra Boys**

In a recent conversation, Bollywood actor Abhishek Bachchan expressed his opinion on the late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, who was convicted for the death of his personal assistant. When asked about Sushant's alleged involvement with the 'Bandra Boys', a group of young men wanted for murder and robbery, Abhishek vehemently claimed that Sushant was the better choice. According to Abhishek, Sushant's 'desi charm' was what made him stand out from the rest. "He had a certain 'kamre mein (at home) tallaiyaar' quality to him," Abhishek said. This statement has sparked a heated debate in the Bollywood circles, with some defending Sushant's innocence and others agreeing with Abhishek's assessment. Regardless of the outcome, it's clear that Sushant's charisma and 'desi vibe' have left an indelible mark on the Bollywood landscape.
