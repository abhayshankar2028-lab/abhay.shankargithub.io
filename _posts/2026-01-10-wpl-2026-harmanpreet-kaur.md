It's the Women's Premier League 2026 and the match is underway as Mumbai Indians (MI) kick-start their season against Delhi Capitals (DC). The defending champions have been on fire, and their high-powered bowling attack is looking to defend their title. Harmanpreet Kaur has been in phenomenal form, taking multiple wickets against the best teams. In contrast, Nat Sciver-Brunt has been in a slightly more ominous mood, with her powerful swing bowling making DC's batsmen struggle. The MI bowlers started the match strongly, with Rajesh Wankhede and Anuja Patil taking tight catches to dismiss DC's top order. With a strong batting lineup and impressive bowling, MI is poised to bounce back quickly and take revenge on their arch-rivals. Can DC recover from their poor start and make it a close match?
