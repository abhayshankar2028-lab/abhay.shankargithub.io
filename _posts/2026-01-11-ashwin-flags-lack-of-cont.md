**Ashwin flags lack of continuity for Arshdeep Singh after 1st ODI snub**

In an exclusive interview with Cricket.com, Indian pacer Ashwinuduwar Arvind "Ashwin" Kumar flags the lack of continuity in his team's bowling lineup after the snubbing of Arshdeep Singh in the first ODI against England.

Arshdeep's impressive form was overlooked by the selectors, leaving many to wonder why he didn't get a chance to showcase his skills in the tournament. Ashwin, on the other hand, has been one of the most consistent bowlers for India in recent years.

When asked about Arshdeep's exclusion, Ashwin expressed his disappointment and frustration. "I think there's a lack of understanding of what I can offer as a bowler," he said. "I've been working hard, and I think my skills have been overlooked. I'm eager to prove myself and earn a spot in the team." Ashwin's comments have sparked a debate among cricket fans, with many questioning the selectors' decision.
