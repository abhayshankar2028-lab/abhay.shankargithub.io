**A Rare Sense of Sadness in South Africa: Allan Donald Reflects on Virat Kohli's Early Exits**

In a candid interview, renowned cricket commentator Allan Donald shared his thoughts on India's star batsman, Virat Kohli, who has announced his retirement from Test cricket at the age of 35. The South African legend expressed his disappointment, stating that Kohli's early departure from the game seems premature and may have been the result of 'a combination of factors.' Like AB de Villiers, who retired at the same age, Donald believes Kohli's decision may have been influenced by a combination of personal and professional factors. The comments echo Donald's own experiences with player burnout and the pressures of maintaining an elite level of performance. As Kohli embarks on the next chapter of his cricketing journey, fans are left to ponder the decision that led to his early retirement.
