**Rishabh Pant Injured, Dhuv Jurel Takes Replacements in IND vs NZ ODI Series**

In a shocking development, India's Rishabh Pant has suffered a severe injury that has forced him to drop out of the upcoming ODI series against New Zealand. Pant, who was expected to lead the team throughout the series, has been ruled out due to a severely damaged finger. 

In a surprise move, Dhruv Jurel has been drafted in as Pant's replacement in the ODI squad. Jurel, who has shown impressive skills in domestic cricket, will take over as Pant's batting partner. The decision has left fans and pundits alike in a state of shock, raising concerns about Pant's long-term health and fitness. With Pant out, India will now face a tough challenge in the upcoming ODI series against New Zealand.
