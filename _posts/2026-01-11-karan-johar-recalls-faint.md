Karan Johar, the renowned Indian film director, actor, and producer, recently spoke about his past struggles with dieting and weight. During an interview, he recalled that he would often faint in college due to extreme dieting. The director, who is known for films like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and My Name Is Khan, shared that his mother had a rather blunt approach to his weight. She would call him 'fat' and 'large', and Johar admits that it didn't make him feel good. However, he also revealed that he is not on any weight loss medication, such as Ozempic. The director emphasized that he takes care of his health in a healthy way, rather than resorting to drastic measures. With his upcoming projects on track, it seems Karan Johar is focusing on a more sustainable approach to weight management.
