In a candid conversation with our blogger, Bollywood filmmaker Karan Johar opened up about his struggles with weight and body image in the past. During an interview, he shared that during his college days, he would often faint due to extreme dieting. The filmmaker revealed that his mother would call him 'fat' and 'large', emphasizing the negative perceptions he faced.

Karan expressed that he was not on any medication like Ozempic to achieve the desired weight. Instead, he relied on his mother's constant encouragement to stick to his diet. Sharing his childhood experiences, Karan emphasized that body positivity is essential, and we should not be defined by the opinions of others. He stressed that we should focus on our well-being and not worry about our physical appearance.
