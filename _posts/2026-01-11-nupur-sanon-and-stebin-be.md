I think there might have been a slight mix-up. Here's a 150-word post for you:

The lovely couple Stebin Ben and Nupur Sanon tied the knot in an intimate Christian wedding ceremony that left everyone in awe. The dreamy day took place at the beautiful Aravalli Estate in Jodhpur. Amongst the guests was none other than Disha Patani and Mouni Roy, who couldn't help but be a part of this unforgettable celebration. Stebin, looking dashing in his attire, beamed with happiness as he exchanged vows with his lovely bride. Nupur looked stunning in her elegant white gown, adorned with delicate lace and intricate details. The ceremony was performed by a renowned Christian priest, who added his own special touch to the ceremony. As Stebin and Nupur shared their first kiss as husband and wife, it was clear that this union was meant to be. Their love story is a shining example of the power of true devotion.
