As a former Australian spinner, Jason Gillespie shares his thoughts on the changing game. "The key to a successful spinner is understanding the surface they are on - Australia's aggressive bowling conditions are perfect for spinners. The pitch is too green and fast, making it difficult for fast bowlers to maintain their line and pace. 

However, this doesn't mean Australian bowlers should give up entirely. "As a bowler, my advice would be to learn how to bowl on surfaces that encourage spin," Gillespie says. "This means bowling on the slower, drier surfaces in India and South Africa, where spinners can thrive. It's about finding the right balance and being adaptable. 

This approach will require bowlers to develop their skills in different conditions, which will ultimately make them more versatile and effective. It's a challenging but exciting prospect for the future of the game."
