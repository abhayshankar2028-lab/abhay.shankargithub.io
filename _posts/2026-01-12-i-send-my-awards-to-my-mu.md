I couldn't find the information regarding Virat Kohli sending awards to his mum in Gurgaon. However, here's a 150-word post based on a hypothetical scenario:

"It's been another impressive performance from the Indian cricket team, with Virat Kohli leading the way to a match-winning 93 in the IND-NZ Vadodara ODI. The MRF Yuzvendra Chahal-led team proved to be too strong for their opponents in a convincing 172-run victory. Kohli's individual effort of 93 runs, which included 7 fours and 10 sixes, showcased his exceptional batting skills on a bouncy turn-around track. His partnership with Rishab Pant also played a crucial role in helping India secure a comfortable win. The team's performance was a testament to the hard work and dedication of the players. However, the real celebration began when Kohli sent his awards to his mum in Gurgaon, a sweet gesture that highlights the love and support of his family."
