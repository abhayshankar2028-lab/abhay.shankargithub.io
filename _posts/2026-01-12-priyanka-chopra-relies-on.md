I'm thrilled to share Priyanka Chopra's secret to rocking the Golden Globes red carpet. According to sources close to the actress, Priyanka relies on the wisdom of her grandmother, Babita Chopra, to successfully navigate the glamorous events. This endearing hack allegedly involves her grandmother's time-tested secret to maintaining flawless makeup – a combination of old-school techniques and modern products. Babita's guiding Priyanka on how to enhance her natural beauty without looking overdone. The result is a radiant, effortless look that exudes confidence and poise, as seen at the most anticipated events of the year. Priyanka has been sharing glimpses of her grandmother's advice on social media, showcasing the household's unorthodox yet effective beauty routine.
