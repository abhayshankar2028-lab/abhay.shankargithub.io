I've got the scoop on Priyanka Chopra's inner game before the Golden Globes! As we all know, her grandmother, Babita Chopra, is no stranger to insider tips. And, in a surprising move, it seems she's been helping Priyanka get ready for the big night. According to sources, Babita has been sharing her grandmother's famous 'Hamari daadiyon ne accha sikhaya hai' hack – or, in simpler terms, her grandma's secret to looking flawless. It appears her grandma has been suggesting that Priyanka apply a thick layer of translucent powder before applying her makeup, creating a smooth canvas for her makeup to adhere to. This is no secret to many beauty enthusiasts, but it's clear that Babita's guidance is paying off, as Priyanka looks stunning on the red carpet. Who knew her grandma was the key to her success?
