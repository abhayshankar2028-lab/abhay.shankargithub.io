I'm delighted to share a fascinating story from Priyanka Chopra's life! As the Golden Globes took place, Priyanka Chopra sought the wisdom of her grandmother. In an exclusive interview, she revealed that her grandmother employed a clever trick to ace the red carpet – she'd apply a hair oil to her hair and would live like a princess to match her glamorous look. This hack, known as the 'grandmother's secret,' was passed down through generations, and it seems to work wonders. Priyanka's grandmother, affectionately known as 'daadi,' is the one who has been perfecting this technique for years. By applying the hair oil, Priyanka Chopra aimed to create an effortless, magical look that would make her stand out on the red carpet. It's clear that Priyanka's grandmother was the perfect guide to help her shine at the Golden Globes.
