A recent rumor has been circulating about the team's ODI plans, suggesting that Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Gautam Gambhir might have casual conversations discussing the future of the team. However, this rumor has been thoroughly debunked by the team's Indian cricket captain, Rohit Sharma.

In an interview, Rohit stated, "We've been discussing our ODI plans and the upcoming series with Australia. We need to focus on our game and prepare for the new series." When asked about the rumors of Kohli and Gambhir discussing ODI plans, Rohit laughed off the speculation, saying, "There's no truth to these rumors. We've got a busy schedule ahead of us, and we need to prioritize our practice sessions."

Sitanshu Kotak, a renowned cricket expert, has come to Rohit's defense, stating, "I've been rubbing shoulders with these players for years, and I can assure you that there's no truth to these rumors. They're just discussing their ODI plans and preparing for the new series."
