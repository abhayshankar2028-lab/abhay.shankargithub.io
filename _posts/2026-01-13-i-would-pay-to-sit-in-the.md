In a recent interview, former India captain R Ashwin has expressed his admiration for New Zealand's approach to the game during their recent series against India. Ashwin, who now plays for the Royal Challengers Bangalore, praised New Zealand's meticulous planning and analytical mindset.

"I would pay to sit in their team meetings," Ashwin said. "They have a very structured approach, and that's what makes them so successful. They're always thinking about the game, not just about the next ball. It's a great thing to see, and it's something that India needs to work on if we want to beat them." Ashwin acknowledged that India's traditional attacking style often puts them at a disadvantage against New Zealand's more defensive approach. He believes this is an area that India can improve upon to become a more formidable opponent.
