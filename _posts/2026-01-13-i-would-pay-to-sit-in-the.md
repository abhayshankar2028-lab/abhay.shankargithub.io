It's not often we see bowlers praising the opposition's batting approach, but R Ashwin recently expressed admiration for New Zealand's planning and analytical way of batting against India. During the test series, New Zealand's batting unit made strategic decisions that paid off, particularly when they were faced with India's strong and aggressive bowling attack. The key to their success lay in their ability to analyze the opposition's strengths and weaknesses, and adjust their batting accordingly.

As a bowler, it's almost laughable to think that one can sit in a team meeting and pay to attend, but Ashwin's praise for New Zealand's approach is undoubtedly a testament to the value of intelligent batting. If Indian bowlers can employ such an analytical mindset, it could be a game-changer for the team. The Indian cricket team needs to take notice of New Zealand's innovative approach and implement it to gain an edge over their opponents.
