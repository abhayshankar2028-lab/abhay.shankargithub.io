**WPL Matches to Be Played Behind Closed Doors**

The WPL (Women's Premier League) is set to take place behind closed doors this week as the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has announced that the provincial polls will delay the schedule. The WPL will now kick off on Wednesday and Thursday, with the matches taking place without spectators present.

This decision comes amidst the ongoing BCI polls that will see the election of new governing body members. The WPL's organizers have hinted that the matches might be held at the same venues as the upcoming polls, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the schedule.

Fans will be left wondering what the future holds for the WPL's revival efforts. Despite the uncertainty, the tournament is still expected to take place, which only adds to the excitement and anticipation among cricket enthusiasts.
