I'm thrilled to share a heart-wrenching tale of a Bollywood legend who's speaking truth to power. Veteran actor, Rajesh Khanna, recently shared a shocking story about his demanding work schedule. According to him, his demanding producers kept him working for 8-hour shifts without any breaks. The pressure to meet film deadlines would often leave Rajesh stranded in insect-infested rooms with barely any amenities.

To make matters worse, he had no beds to sleep on, leaving him with little rest. It's a stark reminder that the glamour of Bollywood is far from the reality on set. Rajesh's tale is a testament to the grueling conditions faced by many in the film industry. His courageous sharing of his story has sparked a much-needed conversation about work-life balance and the need for better working conditions. Long live the truth-tellers!
