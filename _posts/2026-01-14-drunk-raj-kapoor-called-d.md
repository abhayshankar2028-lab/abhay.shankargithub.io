**A Night to Remember: The Unforgettable Encounter**

It's a shocking tale from the glamorous world of Bollywood, where even legends of the industry weren't immune to the whims of a drunken Raj Kapoor. On a fateful night, an intoxicated Kapoor allegedly called superstar Dev Anand, demanding that the film 'Guide' be shown to him. Anand, still reeling from a dinner party the previous day, fell for the ruse. Over the phone, Kapoor swore on his honor that he remembered every line, every dance step, and every iconic scene from the movie. Dev Anand, visibly distraught, replied that the next day he had forgotten everything – including his phone number. The incident left fans stunned, wondering how Kapoor had managed to deceive such a renowned actor. This is a story that will be etched in the annals of Bollywood history for generations to come.
