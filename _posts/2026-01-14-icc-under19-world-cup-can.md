**Under-19 Cricket: Can Vaibhav Suryanashi and Ayush Mhatre Emerge as Future Stars?**

The 2023 ICC Under-19 World Cup is underway, featuring some of the world's best young cricketers. Among the talented contenders is Vaibhav Suryanashi and Ayush Mhatre. Both players have already shown their skills in the domestic circuit and international tournaments.

Yuvraj Singh, Kaif, and Kohli are considered among the greatest batsmen of all time. They have been instrumental in India's success in the under-19 cricket world cup. If Vaibhav Suryanashi and Ayush Mhatre can replicate their form, they could potentially join the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni.

Suryanashi has already demonstrated his batting prowess in the domestic cricket circuit. Meanwhile, Mhatre has impressed with his aggressive batting style in the Indian Premier League. With consistent practice and hard work, these two players have the potential to become all-time greats in the sport.
