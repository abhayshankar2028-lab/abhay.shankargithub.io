Dodda Ganesh here, and I've been analyzing the crucial match between India and New Zealand. The standout performance from KL Rahul has left everyone wondering – is he a game-changer or just another athlete who needs guidance?

I firmly believe that pushing him to no 6, below Axar/Jadeja, is going to be a cardinal sin. The reason is simple – both Axar and Jadeja are seasoned players who have been around the block a few times. They know what it takes to adapt to the Indian bowlers, and they can counter any batsman. Rahul, on the other hand, is a youngster who needs to learn the ropes quickly.

As we saw in the match, Rahul's patience and ability to adjust to different bowlers will be crucial in his long run with the bat. If he can find the right balance, he might just become a force to be reckoned with.
