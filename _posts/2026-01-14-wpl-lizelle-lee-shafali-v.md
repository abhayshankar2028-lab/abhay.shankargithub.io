**Delhi Capitals Secure Last-Ball Thriller over UP Warriorz**

The Women's Premier League (WPL) witnessed a nail-biting finish as Delhi Capitals defeated UP Warriorz by a single run in a thrilling encounter at the Holkar Stadium in Indore. Delhi Capitals' star batswoman Lizelle Lee dominated the game, scoring an unbeaten 50 off 52 deliveries. Meanwhile, Shafali Verma added 29 not out off 27 balls, but it was not enough to overcome the team's 99/2 status at the close.

However, Delhi Capitals' ability to bat for a full session ultimately paid off. With the score locked at 99-2 at the end of 50 overs, they managed to bat out the remaining 8 overs to secure a last-ball win. This win cements Delhi Capitals' position at the top of the WPL table, leaving UP Warriorz in second place.
