**BPL Players Boycott BCB Over Director's Offense**

A high-profile controversy has erupted in Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) as several players, including senior star Nazrul Islam, have boycotted the ongoing season. The reason behind this boycott lies in a recent remark made by BCB (Bangladesh Cricket Board) director, Nizamuddin Ahmed. Ahmed's comment on a specific player's performance sparked widespread outrage among the players and fans. Nazrul Islam took to his Twitter account to express his disappointment, stating that Ahmed's remark was not just 'unfair', but also 'inaccurate'. The BCB director must have been aware of the players' dismay and chose to remain silent. This incident highlights the importance of addressing sensitive topics with care and respect in the Bangladesh cricket ecosystem. The BCB must take responsibility for its director's actions and ensure that players are treated with the respect they deserve.
