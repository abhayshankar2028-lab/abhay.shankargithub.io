**FIDE Announces Major Overhauls to Candidates Qualification Circuit Path**

The International Cricket Family has made significant announcements regarding the Candidates Qualification (CQ) circuit. In a move aimed at streamlining the selection process and reducing costs, FIDE has announced a major overhaul to the circuit path.

The current circuit path will be merged into a single cycle, consisting of 12 top-ranked players competing in a round-robin format. This change simplifies the selection process, reducing the number of tournaments required to qualify for the Candidates Tournament.

The new cycle will begin in 2027, with the 12 top-ranked players selected to participate in the Candidates Qualification tournament. The Candidates Tournament, previously held in 2026, will remain unchanged. This reform aims to increase the competitiveness of the Candidates Qualification tournament and provide a more stable platform for top players to compete.
