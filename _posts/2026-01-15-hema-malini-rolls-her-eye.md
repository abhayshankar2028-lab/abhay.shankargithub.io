**A Shocking Moment in Mumbai BMC Elections: Hema Malini's Tweet Sparks Awe and Shock**

In a candid tweet, senior citizen Harishchandra Prajapati complained about the mismanagement at a poll booth in Mumbai, prompting actress Hema Malini to roll her eyes. Prajapati, a veteran election observer, tweeted his outrage, stating, "Polling station is a mess. The voting machines are malfunctioning and the staff is unprofessional. How can a city like Mumbai, which prides itself on being a proud and resilient nation, be plagued by such inefficiencies?"

Hema Malini, known for her outspoken views, responded with a witty remark, "Poor senior citizens, they must have been voting during the Rajneet Singh era. The BMC must do better to avoid such embarrassments." The tweet sparked a mix of reactions, with some defending Prajapati's right to voice his concerns and others arguing that Hema Malini's response was insensitive. The exchange highlights the challenges faced by the BMC in managing elections amidst growing voter turnout.
