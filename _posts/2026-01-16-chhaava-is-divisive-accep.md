I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge our difficult discussion on Chhaava. While I understand why many people have taken issue with the film, I firmly believe that it's a polarizing work that elicits strong emotions from its audience. In fact, I hold AR Rahman's contributions to the film to be genuine and heartfelt, and his music is undeniably an integral part of its charm. However, I also believe that some viewers have misinterpreted his involvement, focusing on the perceived negative undertones in certain scenes. I agree that these scenes can be jarring and awkward at times, which might detract from the overall impact of the film. Nevertheless, I firmly stand by AR Rahman's involvement and the endearing nature of his score. Ultimately, opinions may vary, but I'm willing to respectfully disagree with those who share the film's divisive nature.
