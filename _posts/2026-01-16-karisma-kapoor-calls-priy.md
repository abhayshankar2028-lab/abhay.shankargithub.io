Karisma Kapoor has expressed her strong stance against Priya Sachdev's ambitious attempt to obtain her divorce papers with Sunjay Kapur. The actress shared her thoughts on social media, stating that Priya's plan is an 'exorbitant and frivolous' move.

She also subtly hinted at Priya's alleged motives, suggesting that the actress may be trying to "buy" her way out of the marriage. However, Priya's sister has been quick to defend her relative's actions, stating that the divorce papers remain confidential and that Karisma is just trying to protect her personal life.

Sunjay Kapur's family and the couple themselves have yet to comment on the matter. Karisma has served as Priya's confidante and help in various endeavors, and her words carry significant weight in this delicate situation.
