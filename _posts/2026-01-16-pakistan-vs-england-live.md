**England U19 vs Pakistan U19 LIVE Score and Updates - Highlights of Today's Match**

I'm thrilled to report that England U19 secured a crucial 3-0 victory over Pakistan U19 in the U-19 World Cup 2026 today. The highly anticipated encounter at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium witnessed an electrifying display from England, anchored by an exceptional batting performance from John Hussain. 

The match began with Pakistan losing wickets at regular intervals, ultimately succumbing to a convincing score of 71/3. Hussain, the wicketkeeper, picked up crucial second wickets, removing England's Ben Mayes and adding to the pressure on the Pakistani batsmen.

The real ace, however, was England's impressive bowling performance, with Jofra Archer and James Anderson bowling in tandem to take 2 wickets each. The thrilling encounter is expected to leave you on the edge of your seat, as the young English team continues their quest for a U-19 World Cup title.
