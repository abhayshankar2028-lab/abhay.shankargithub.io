In a shocking incident, former Australian cricketer David Boon took a dare and downed 52 beers on a trip from Australia to England. The incident has sparked a debate about England's senior Ashes team's 'drinking crisis'. The beverage binge reportedly began as a one-night drinking session, which eventually led to Boon being hospitalized due to dehydration and a possible stomach infection. Boon later admitted to taking excessive amounts of alcohol, stating that his decision was 'just a silly dare'. Boon's actions have caused concern among the English cricket team, who have since emphasized their low tolerance for excessive drinking. As a result, there have been discussions about introducing stricter policies to curb excessive drinking among the team members.
