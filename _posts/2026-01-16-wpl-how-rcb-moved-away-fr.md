**RCB's Shift towards Collectivism: A Winning Formula Underpinning Success in WPL**

The Royals Challengers Bangalore (RCB) have been putting their collective effort to the test in the Women's Premier League (WPL). In recent games, they've shifted their strategy towards a more collectivist approach, prioritizing team success over individual performances. This mentality has been instrumental in their extended winning streak, with the team consistently winning matches by large margins.

The shift in focus has not gone unnoticed, as fans and analysts alike praise the team's collective spirit and camaraderie. RCB's captain, Harbinger Singh, attributes the change to an 'us vs. them mentality,' where the team believes in working together to overcome obstacles. This has paid off, as the team has consistently performed to their full potential, resulting in a remarkable run of wins.
