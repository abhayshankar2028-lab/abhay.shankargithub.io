In a fascinating conversation with a close friend of the late Bollywood legend, Dev Anand, I was left wondering about a crucial detail from his life. The question that often comes to mind is, how did aamir khan manage to be so calm and composed despite his private nature? Dev Anand's close friend shared with me a heartwarming anecdote about meeting Aamir Khan for the first time.

The story goes that when Dev Anand asked Aamir Khan about the story and script of his film, the superstar surprisingly didn't even bat an eyelid. "It's amazing how Aamir Khan didn't even ask about the money involved," his friend quipped. The man seemed utterly uninterested in the financial aspects of his work, showcasing an air of tranquility that was quite refreshing.
