In a shocking twist, the Big Bash League episode turned into a heated discussion when popular cricketers Basit Ali and Kamran Akmal joined the conversation. During the commentary, Basit Ali made an astonishing comparison between Virat Kohli and Babar Azam, stating that if Kohli wanted to single-handedly win the World Cup, he could do so just like Babar Azam single-handedly wins the tournament.

Kamran Akmal chimed in, saying, "You're right, Basit. If Virat Kohli wanted to take Babar Azam down, he could do it single-handedly! The way Kohli and Babar have complemented each other, it's a perfect example of a strong partnership in cricket. Steve Smith's family might be proud of Virat's ambition, but let's be real, he can take down Babar Azam on his own if he wants to!"

The audience erupted in laughter and applause, with many teasing Basit Ali about his bold prediction.
