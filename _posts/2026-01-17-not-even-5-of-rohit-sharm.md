Manoj Tiwary took to social media to express his disappointment after being quizzed by assistant coach, Ten Doeschate, about Rohit Sharma's achievements. Tiwary, who met the Dutch coach in 2018, was visibly frustrated when Doeschate stated, "I don't know if one person is more impressive than him." 

The 32-year-old cricketer felt that Doeschate's comment was 'demoralising' and a reflection of the team's mental state. Tiwary believes that such remarks can affect the team's morale. "Rohit is an exceptional player, and if he's not performing well, it's because of his hard work and dedication, not because of any individual's achievement," Tiwary said. Tiwary also praised Rohit for his leadership and cooperation with the coaching staff.
