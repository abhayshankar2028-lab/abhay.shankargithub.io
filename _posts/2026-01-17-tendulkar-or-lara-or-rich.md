**A Cricket Legacy: A Legendary Debate**

In a world where cricket legends leave an indelible mark, the debate rages on between Sachin Tendulkar, Sir Don Bradman, and Sir Vivian Richards. At the crux of this discussion is Mark Waugh, a former Australian captain known for his grappling style of batting. 

Mark Waugh picks Sachin Tendulkar as his greatest batsman, praising his enduring record and unmatched milestones. He also mentions Tendulkar's ability to score at various fields of the field, indicating his command over all aspects of the game. 

However, Waugh was not one to shy away from criticism. He recalls a memorable exchange with Sir Vivian Richards during India's 1992 Test tour of England. Richards, frustrated by Waugh's disbelieving expression, fired back with a sledge: "You're a bloke out of your mind, you don't know me!" The exchange would become a defining moment in their on-field rivalry.
