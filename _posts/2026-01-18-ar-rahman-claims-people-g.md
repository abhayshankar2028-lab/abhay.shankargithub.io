**Two Oscars Can Be a Burden**

At an exclusive roundtable discussion at the recent Filmfare Awards, renowned composer AR Rahman candidly opened up about the emotional turmoil he faced after receiving two consecutive Oscars for his film 'Alaaga Paravaz'. During the conversation, Rahman expressed how he was gaslighted by some people into thinking that his work was no longer doing well. He shared how the pressure of receiving two Oscars was immense, and how it impacted his mental health.

Rahman stated, 'Two Oscars can be a burden. When you have to cope with the weight of others' expectations, it can take a toll on your mental health.' He emphasized that it's essential to remember that success is not solely measured by the number of awards one receives. As he highlighted, 'The true measure of success lies in the love and appreciation of the people who matter most in your life.'
