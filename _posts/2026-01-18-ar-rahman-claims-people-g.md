Bollywood's maestro, A. R. Rahman, recently opened up about the mind-blowing experience of incorporating the iconic song 'Jai Ho' into the 2013 Oscar-winning film 'Slumdog Millionaire'. He expressed his gratitude for the film's success, but later expressed his frustration over the negative perception of his work.

Rahman revealed that, at the time, many people doubted his involvement in the project, and he felt he wasn't doing good work anymore. He says that the experience taught him a valuable lesson about the challenges of reinventing oneself and facing skepticism. 'Two Oscars can be a burden,' he said. Rahman emphasized the importance of staying true to one's art and not letting external opinions dictate one's self-worth. This honest admission highlights the complexities of creative expression and the ever-changing landscape of the film industry.
