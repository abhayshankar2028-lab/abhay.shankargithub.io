Bollywood fans, it's time to shine a light on the fascinating yet often tumultuous side of the music industry. In a recent interview, renowned composer AR Rahman has shared his harrowing story of being gaslighted by industry insiders. According to Rahman, he was repeatedly told he wasn't producing "good enough" work, despite his unwavering dedication and genius. The gaslighting, he claims, took a toll on his mental health, making him question his abilities. 

Rahman's cautionary tale also touches on the 'two Oscars can be a burden' mantra, a phrase that has been echoing through the music world for years. The statement has sparked a heated debate, with some defending the idea that success breeds self-doubt, while others argue that creative expression should be celebrated without fear of criticism. As we reflect on Rahman's story, it's clear that the music industry is full of complexities, and it's time to acknowledge the mental health implications of being a creative force.
