AR Rahman recently shared an eye-opening story in which he confessed that people gaslighted him into doubting his own abilities. In an interview, the renowned composer revealed that the constant barrage of doubts from well-wishers at home and abroad left him questioning his talent and work ethic. He shared, 'Two Oscars can be a burden. The pressure to produce great music is immense, and when you reach that point, you start to doubt yourself.' AR Rahman's candid admission sparked a poignant conversation about the pressures of artistic success. It's a reminder that even the most accomplished individuals need to remember that their worth and value lie not just in external validation, but also in their own self-worth and creative expression.
