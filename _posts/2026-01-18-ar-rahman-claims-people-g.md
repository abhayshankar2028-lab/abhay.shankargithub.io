Bollywood's own maestro AR Rahman recently shared his own experience of feeling undervalued and gaslighted. During an interview with a prominent news outlet, he revealed how a few years ago, he didn't receive the recognition he thought he deserved. The veteran composer mentioned that multiple film industry personalities told him that he wasn't doing 'good work anymore'. This, he claims, led him to doubt his abilities and undermine his confidence.

Shining a light on the harsh realities of the industry, AR Rahman emphasized that two Oscars can indeed be a burden. Not only does it bring immense pressure, but it also puts immense pressure on the artist themselves. "Two Oscars can be a burden," he stated, "a reminder that success is not a guarantee and that one's talent is not enough." His poignant words remind us that the journey to success is never easy, and sometimes it takes unwavering courage to speak up and remind ourselves of our worth.
