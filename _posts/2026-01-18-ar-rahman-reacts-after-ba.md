In a shocking twist, renowned composer AR Rahman faced backlash for his recent comments suggesting that the Hindi film industry has become communal. The 71-year-old maestro expressed his sentiments in a recent interview, stating that the industry's emphasis on communal sentiments and caste has led to a "bottleneck" in creativity.

The backlash was swift and severe, with many taking to social media to express their disappointment at Rahman's remarks. While the composer maintained that he never wished to cause pain, his words had sparked a heated debate within the industry. Rahman has since apologized for his comments, stating that he meant no offense. However, the controversy has raised questions about the industry's approach to diversity and inclusivity. The question now is – will the industry take a hard look at its past practices and strive for greater creative freedom?
