In a recent interview, renowned singer Hariharan, known for his iconic rendition of AR Rahman's 'Tu Hi Re', shares his thoughts on the evolving landscape of Hindi music. Interestingly, Hariharan highlights the shift in power dynamics within the industry. He emphasizes that one must prioritize creativity over financial gains. "You have to think about the music first and the money later," he remarks.
