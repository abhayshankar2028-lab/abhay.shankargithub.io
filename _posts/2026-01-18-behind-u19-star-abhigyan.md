Abhigyan Kundu, the 17-year-old U-19 cricketer, has been making waves in the cricketing world. What sets him apart from the rest is his unorthodox coaching style. As a seasoned coach, Kundu would often arrange for his star pupil, Abhigyan, to sleep at the local railway station. This unconventional plan proved to be a game-changer for the young cricketer.

His parents, initially hesitant to intervene, ultimately came to respect and admire Kundu's unorthodox methods. This unique approach has undoubtedly played a significant role in Abhigyan's meteoric rise, and cricketing world is taking notice of this inspiring underdog story.
