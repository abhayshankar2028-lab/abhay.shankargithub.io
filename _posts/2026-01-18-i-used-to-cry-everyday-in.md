In an emotional and introspective interview, India pacer Harshit Rana opened up about his past struggles with handling failures. Born in Nepal, Rana's journey to the Indian national team was not an easy one, with several setbacks and disappointments along the way.

During the 2018 World Cup, Rana's dream of winning the tournament was shattered when he was replaced in the final against New Zealand. This experience left him deeply hurt and often made him cry in front of his family.

However, Rana has since learned to channel his emotions into his cricket. He credits his family, particularly his father, for their unwavering support and encouragement throughout his journey. "Handling failures is a crucial part of being a professional. You have to be strong enough to bounce back and keep moving forward," Rana shared, his voice filled with emotion.
