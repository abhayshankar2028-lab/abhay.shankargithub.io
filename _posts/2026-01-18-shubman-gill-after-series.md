As the Indian cricket team's series defeat against New Zealand continues to weigh heavily on the minds of fans, a crucial aspect of their performance fell short: the ability to convert starts into impressive innings. A standout performer in the series, Shubman Gill, highlighted a glaring concern. 

During the New Zealand innings, the batting duo of Gill and Rashid Khan struggled to capitalize on strong starts. Gill, in particular, faced stiff conditions, but ultimately fell short of transforming his starts into clutch innings. The lack of consistency in this aspect has raised questions about the team's overall strategy.

Gill's comments have sparked debate about the team's approach to batting, particularly in the early stages of the series. The Indian team will need to reassess their strategy and work on converting starts into success if they hope to bounce back from this setback.
