In a scathing commentary on the Indian cricket setup, former Indian leg-spinner Priyank Panchal took aim at former England coach Eoin Morgan's suggestion that the Indian team's success is hindered by foreign coaches. Panchal, a vocal critic of the current Indian team management, made the comments in an interview, stating that foreign coaches like Morgan don't understand the depth of Indian cricket.

He specifically targets England's coach, Jos Buttler, who, along with Morgan, earlier expressed concerns regarding the Indian team's playing style. Panchal believes that the atmosphere created by these foreign coaches leads to a lack of innovation and a rigid approach, stifling the creativity of Indian players. The comments have sparked a heated debate, with many Indian fans and pundits defending the current team management.
