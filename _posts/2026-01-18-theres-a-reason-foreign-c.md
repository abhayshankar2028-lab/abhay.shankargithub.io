In a scathing rebuke, Indian cricket captain Priyank Panchal has fired back at Dutch coach Jacques Kallis' comments about the team's batting lineup. Kallis claimed, 'The Indians are running out of ideas with Rohit Sharma at the top. If you get that one batsman who's a 50% opener, you'll struggle.' Panchal addressed the remark, saying, 'I understand the pressure to score, but we have a well-balanced team. Rohit's not the sole reason our bowling, batting, and fielding are not working together. We need to improve as a unit, not just one player.' Panchal insisted that their performance has been consistent throughout the season, despite the Dutch coach's criticism. The captain emphasized that India's success lies in their collective effort, not just individual brilliance.
