**Australia T20I Tour of Pakistan: A Scramble to Rebuild**

The Australian cricket team has been dealing with a couple of setbacks before embarking on their upcoming T20I tour of Pakistan. In a bizarre turn of events, injured star batsman Pat Cummins and leg-spinner Josh Hazlewood have been left out of the last series against Pakistan. Cummins, who has been the backbone of Australia's T20I team, has undergone an ankle injury, which will keep him out for the tour. Meanwhile, Hazlewood, a key player in Australia's T20I lineup, has been forced to withdraw from the tour due to a knee injury. This juggling act for Australia will be crucial for them to successfully navigate their upcoming series against Pakistan. The team will now have to rely on other talented players like Mitchell Starc and David Warner to fill the gaps.
