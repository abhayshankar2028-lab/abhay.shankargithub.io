**Australia's T20I Tour of Pakistan: A Bittersweet Return for Oval Invincibles**

The highly anticipated Australia T20I tour of Pakistan has kicked off, marking a crucial step towards the upcoming ICC Men's T20 World Cup. However, two crucial batsmen have been left out of the initial squad.

Pat Cummins, the Australian all-rounder, has suffered a severe ankle injury, forcing him to miss the tour. Josh Hazlewood, another key player, has been left out of the squad as he continues to work his way back from a wrist injury.

This decision has raised concerns among fans, as both players possess immense value to Australia's T20I squad. The omission may have sparked tensions, but it's essential to remember that injuries can happen to anyone. Let's wait and see how these injuries develop, and how Australia responds to the challenges ahead in Pakistan.
