**Dhurandhar: A Thrilling Ride Through the Indian Box Office!**

Ranveer Singh's much-anticipated film, Dhurandhar, has been hitting the screens for quite some time now, and the numbers don't lie! As we approach the 45th day of its release, the film has managed to cross a staggering Rs 875 crore in India alone. While this is a significant milestone, it's still short of the impressive figure that 'Pushpa 2' achieved globally.

Projected to surpass Rs 400 crore worldwide, Dhurandhar's journey is an inspiring reminder of the power of perseverance and dedication. With over 700 shows across India and a massive fan base, Ranveer Singh's debut film is proving to be a massive hit. Let's hope this trend continues and takes Dhurandhar to even greater heights!
