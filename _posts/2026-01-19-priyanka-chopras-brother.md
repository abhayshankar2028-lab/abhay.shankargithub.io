It's been a while since Priyanka Chopra's rise to stardom, and her journey has not been without its challenges. Her brother, Mohit Chopra, has been a significant figure in her life, but unfortunately, his involvement in her personal life came at a cost.

As Madhu Chopra, Priyanka's mother, shares her thoughts, "My son often used to talk about Priyanka's stardom. But I never thought it would affect him personally. Now, I see him struggling every day, trying to keep up with his career, while also dealing with the stress and pressure of his family's expectations." Her words emphasize the complex dynamics at play, where the pressures of fame can weigh heavily on family members. It's clear that Priyanka and Mohit's relationship has been put to the test, as she navigates her career and personal life.
