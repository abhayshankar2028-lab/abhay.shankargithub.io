**A Most Unwanted Chapter in Priyanka Chopra's Rise to Stardom**

In an exclusive interview, Madhu Chopra, Priyanka's mother, has opened up about the challenging time the family faced after her daughter's stardom began to take center stage. According to Madhu, Priyanka's brother, Shahid Kapoor, became collateral damage to her stardom, constantly jumping between projects and scenes. Madhu laments how this changed the family's dynamics, with Shahid often appearing in supporting roles while Priyanka focused on her main projects. Not only did this affect their family life but also strained their relationships, particularly with Priyanka's parents, who felt that their daughter's priorities were elsewhere. As Madhu expresses her concern, it's clear that Shahid's role in Priyanka's stardom has created an unwritten script for her life, where family and career often come into conflict.
