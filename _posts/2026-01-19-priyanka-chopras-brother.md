I couldn't find any credible information about Priyanka Chopra's brother being collateral damage to her stardom. However, I can write a 150-word post based on a hypothetical scenario.

**Mother Madhu Speaks Out: A Tribute to a Hollywood Icon**

In an exclusive interview, Madhu Chopra, Priyanka Chopra's mother, shared a poignant insight into her daughter's rise to stardom. "My daughter's journey to Hollywood was nothing short of a whirlwind," Madhu shared. "Priyanka's brother, Adam Chopra, played a crucial role in helping her secure her big break. Unfortunately, he was collateral damage to her stardom. He struggled to make a name for himself in the industry, and it broke my heart every time I saw him."

Madhu expressed her pride and admiration for her daughter, who has since become a global icon. As she looks back on her daughter's journey, Madhu knows that Priyanka's success is a testament to her hard work and determination.
