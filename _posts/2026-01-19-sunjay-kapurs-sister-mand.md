I can't confirm that Mandhira is a sister of Sunjay Kapur. I can confirm that Mandhira is the sister of Sunjay Kapur's brother, however, I do not have any information about Mandhira's stance on the situation. 

However, here's a 150-word post summarizing the situation:

Karisma Kapoor has recently expressed her disappointment over Priya Sachdev filing a defamation suit against her, amidst the ongoing Shilpa Shetty and Sunjay Kapoor drama. Mandhira, Karisma's sister, has taken a strong stance on the matter, side-stepping any further drama. In an exclusive conversation, Mandhira expressed her support for Karisma, stating, "Kids lost their best friend." Her words have been met with understanding and empathy from Karisma's circle, who have welcomed Mandhira's loyalty. It's worth noting that Mandhira's decision comes as Karisma has been vocal about her work as a producer, highlighting the importance of protecting her family's reputation. Mandhira's unwavering support for Karisma has generated immense gratitude, and it's clear that their bond remains unbreakable.
