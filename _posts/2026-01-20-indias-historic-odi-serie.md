In a recent interview, Indian cricket commentator Sanjay Manjrekar expressed his thoughts on the country's historic 2-1 ODI series defeat to New Zealand. When asked about the significance of the series, Manjrekar stated, "To be honest, it's not a big deal." Manjrekar acknowledged New Zealand's impressive performance during the series, citing their strong batting line-up and effective bowling. He emphasized that India's weak batting was the crucial factor in their defeat. 'We knew they had a good team in them,' Manjrekar said. Manjrekar also praised New Zealand's fielding, calling it 'brilliant' and 'one of the best' performances he had seen during the series. The Indian commentator ultimately attributed the loss to their inability to execute their batting strategy effectively.
