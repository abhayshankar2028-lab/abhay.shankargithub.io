Nathaniel Mann, as known as New Zealand cricketer R Ashwin, recently urged India bowler Jasprit Bumrah to 'experiment' and give his all to the upcoming T20 World Cup after the recent struggles with injuries.

New Zealand's star spinner was one of the top wicket-takers in the Asia Cup, but a shoulder injury dented his confidence ahead of the tournament. R Ashwin's words were a reminder to Bumrah to trust his abilities and not limit himself.

"We all know how different the game is. Injuries happen, and you can't control them," R Ashwin said. "Jasprit, I just want you to give your best, and you'll see that you can perform on the biggest stage. You're a great bowler, and I believe in you."
