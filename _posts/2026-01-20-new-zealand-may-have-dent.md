In an interview, former India captain Rohit Sharma has ruled out any talk of mental health issues, but a recent setback may have dented India's confidence heading into the T20 World Cup. According to Indian cricketing legend, R Ashwin, there's no need to rush back to form after struggling with the new ball in the last few matches. Instead, he believes India's bowler should 'experiment' with different bowling strategies. Ashwin has praised the young Indian pacer, who managed to take 2/32 in an innings-dominating performance, but questions his ability to handle pressure in high-stakes T20 matches. "We need to see more of him and experiment with different bowling styles. I believe he's talented enough to take these wickets," Ashwin said.
