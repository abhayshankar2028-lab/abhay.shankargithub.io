Bollywood producer Suniel Shetty recently expressed his support for his actor Varun Dhawan amid online trolling. In a statement, Shetty defended his star and stated that 'it's very easy to run someone down'. He chose to focus on the negativity surrounding his actor instead of venting about it. Shetty used this opportunity to remind everyone that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.

Varun Dhawan's persistent work ethic and talent have garnered the attention of many. It's not surprising that people are criticizing him. However, it's essential to remember that one person's success does not define the entire industry. Shetty's words are a testament to the fact that everyone deserves respect, even if they may not be as successful as others.

Shetty's words remind us that we should focus on supporting each other, rather than tearing each other down. By choosing a positive and constructive approach, we can create a vibrant and inclusive space for everyone to thrive.
