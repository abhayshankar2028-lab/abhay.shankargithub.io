Rumors have been swirling around Bollywood's musical scores, particularly regarding the dominance of one composer over another. Recently, director Ram Gopal Varma broke the silence, claiming Sukhwinder Singh was indeed the real composer behind the iconic song 'Jai Ho'. However, Sukhwinder Singh's involvement in the song remains shrouded in controversy. Varma's statement raises questions about the extent of Sukhwinder Singh's contribution to the musical composition. When asked about the issue, Varma's response was cryptic: "He's the last person to know the truth." While these comments may have been veiled, they seem to suggest that Varma is denying a significant contribution from Sukhwinder Singh. This revelation has sparked discussions about the musical credits of 'Jai Ho', and it remains to be seen how this will impact the film's legacy.
