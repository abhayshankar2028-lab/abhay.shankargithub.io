India vs New Zealand's 1st T20I saw a thrilling conclusion at Eden Park, with New Zealand emerging victorious by 5 wickets. In a statement that will likely be echoed in the world of cricket, Indian pacer Arshdeep Singh expressed his plan to bowl on flat pitches in the future. "Take God's name", Singh quipped, signifying his intention to conquer the new ball. This bold statement has sparked excitement among fans and pundits alike. With the Indian bowling attack consisting of Jasprit Bumrah, Rashid Khan, and Mohammed Shami, Singh's statement may be more than just a jest. New Zealand's bowlers, led by James Neesham, will need to adapt to the bowling conditions and figure out how to counter India's attacking style. The series has already begun, and it's clear that Arshdeep Singh's bold statement will be a central topic of discussion in the coming days.
