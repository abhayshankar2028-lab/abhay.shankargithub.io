**A Tricolour Tragedy: Border 2 Fails to Break Ground in Gulf Countries**

The highly anticipated Bollywood film Border 2, directed by Vishal Bhardwaj and starring Akshay Kumar, began filming in Dubai two years ago. However, the movie's prospects in the Gulf countries have been a mixed bag. Despite its massive star power and highly anticipated storyline, Border 2 has yet to secure a release in countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

In a recent development, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has issued a stern warning to the makers of Border 2, asking them to replace the tricolour flag on the film's war planes and change the name of the warship. The move comes as a significant setback for the film, which was scheduled to release in March. The CBFC's demands have raised concerns among fans and critics alike, who fear that the film's release in the region may be delayed indefinitely.
