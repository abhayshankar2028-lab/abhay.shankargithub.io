"Homebound" received a well-deserved standing ovation at the 93rd Academy Awards, but unfortunately, it missed the coveted Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. 

At the 93rd Oscars, "Homebound" took home four awards, including Best Foreign Language Film, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Editing. The film, directed by Ritesh Batra and co-directed by Blumhouse Productions, beautifully captured the essence of India's communal struggles and social realities.

While the film received widespread acclaim, including a standing ovation, it fell short of the Oscar prize. Despite this, "Homebound" shines as a powerful and thought-provoking cinematic experience. The film's cinematography and editing were truly breathtaking, with moments that left the audience in awe. Unfortunately, it didn't quite reach the heights of its Oscar wins.
