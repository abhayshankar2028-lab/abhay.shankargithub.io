**India's Homebound Withdraws from Oscars 2026 Race**

India's entry, Homebound, took an unexpected exit from the Oscars 2026 race, marking a historic moment for Indian cinema. Homebound, directed by Raajkumar Hirani, was set to compete in the Best Foreign Language Film category. The film, starring Amitabh Bachchan and Sanjana Hui, was set to tell the story of a former Indian police officer who goes undercover to fight against corruption.

Although Homebound didn't secure an Oscar nomination, it has undoubtedly made Indian cinema proud. This historic win has paved the way for Indian films to gain international recognition. The decision by Indian audiences and filmmakers to back Homebound can be seen as a significant step towards promoting Indian cinema globally. Homebound's withdrawal from the Oscars will now be seen as a testament to the film's success and a milestone for Indian cinema.
