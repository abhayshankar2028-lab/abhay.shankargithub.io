**Luck Plays a Crucial Role in Cricket**

In the world of cricket, luck often seems to play a significant role. One cannot deny the fact that even the greatest bowlers need a bit of luck to seal their victory. When it comes to bowling, a single mistake or a slight deviation in the batsman's stance can change the course of the game entirely.

Take Abhishek Sharma and Glenn Phillips as a perfect example. Both are skilled batsmen who have had their fair share of close calls. While Sharma has consistently performed to his potential, Phillips has often been the one who has come out on top, thanks to a bit of luck.
