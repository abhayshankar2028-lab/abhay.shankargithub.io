**Oscars 2026 Nominations: A Heartfelt Takeaway from Homebound's Snub**

In a stunning display of talent, the nominations for the upcoming Oscars 2026 have taken a poignant turn. Homebound, a psychological thriller directed by Neeraj Ghaywan, has been noticeably absent from the list. The film, which boasts an impressive ensemble cast, including Randeep Hooda, Tabu, and Mithila Palkar, left fans and critics alike in a tinge of disappointment.

In a heart-wrenching note, Karan Johar penned an emotional message for Neeraj Ghaywan, urging him to "keep pushing the boundaries of storytelling." While the snub serves as a reminder that not every film needs Oscar recognition, it is a testament to the power of homebound to connect with audiences worldwide.
