**The Tears of Rani Mukerji: "Ghulam" Memories**

Rani Mukerji's performance in 2003's "Ghulam" still brings tears to her eyes. As she reminisces about her iconic portrayal of the strong-willed and determined protagonist, a hint of sadness creeps into her voice. The film, directed by Sooraj Barjatya, was a critical and commercial success, but for Rani, it holds a special place in her heart.

In an interview, Rani revealed that her voice was dubbed in "Ghulam" as it wasn't quite right for the character. While she understands the importance of acting, it's hard not to feel a pang of regret when thinking about how her voice was altered. As she looks back, Rani can't help but feel a sense of nostalgia for the film and the role that made her a star.
