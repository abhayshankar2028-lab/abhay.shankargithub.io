**Sri Lanka Stuns England in ODI Series Opener**

In the highly anticipated opening match of the ODI series, Sri Lanka edged out England by a single run at the Galle International Stadium. With a spirited performance, the home team secured a thrilling victory in the 50-over affair. 

Sri Lanka's spin trio – Dasun Sampurna, Bhanuka Ratnabiri, and Nuwan Pragasam – dominated England's batting lineup, taking crucial wickets at regular intervals. England's opener, Babar Azam, had a remarkable start, but the spinners were relentless in their pursuit of a winning draw.

The match ended with England batting in second innings, trailing Sri Lanka by 1 run. With this impressive start, Sri Lanka is now 1-0 in the series. The Sri Lankan team will look to build on this momentum in the next match.
