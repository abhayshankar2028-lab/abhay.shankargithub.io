**Rashid Khan Leads Sri Lanka to Dominant Victory over England in ODI Series Opener**

The highly anticipated ODI series opener between Sri Lanka and England has come to a close, with Lankan skipper Kusal Perera's team emerging victorious by a convincing 8-wicket margin. The match was played at the R Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo, and Sri Lanka's Rashid Khan proved to be the star of the show, taking 3 crucial wickets to secure a crucial win.

Khan's impressive knock of 55 not out, along with a stunning display from Sri Lanka's middle order, helped his team to reach a formidable total of 184/5. England's Samit Patel and Ben Stokes were the only batsmen to reach double figures, but it was too little, too late for the tourists. With this win, Sri Lanka now leads the 3-match series 1-0, setting up a thrilling showdown in the next match.
