Babar Azam's decision to leave the Sydney Sixers for a national call-up is a significant move. The Pakistani superstar has been the face of the team, scoring crucial runs and taking key wickets. However, he has decided to prioritize the national team over the BBL side, citing a renewed sense of purpose and responsibility.

The 32-year-old all-rounder is expected to make his national debut soon, and fans are eagerly awaiting his return. Sydney Sixers fans will have to wait for the next match to see their star player in action again.
