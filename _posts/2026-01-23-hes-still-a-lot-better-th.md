![‘He’s still a lot better than Shubman Gill’: Ex-India batter says Rohit Sharma must be reappointed ODI captain](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/01/rohit-gill-1.jpg)

In a candid interview with ESPN CricZone, former India batter Virender Sehwag has thrown his weight behind Rohit Sharma, stating that he is still the best choice to lead the team. Sehwag, who last led India in 2019, believes that Sharma's leadership qualities and batting form warrant a second stint as the ODI captain. "Rohit Sharma is still a lot better than Shubman Gill," Sehwag said. "He has the temperament and experience to lead the team to victory. Gill, on the other hand, is still learning the ropes and needs time to develop his skills. The Indian team needs a leader who can inspire his teammates and take charge on the field. Sharma fits the bill, and I strongly believe he should be reappointed as captain." Sehwag's endorsement is a significant blow to Gill, who has been under pressure to perform and regain his spot in the team.
