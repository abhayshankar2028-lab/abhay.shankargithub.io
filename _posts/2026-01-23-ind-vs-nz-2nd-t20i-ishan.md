**IND vs NZ 2nd T20I: Ishan and Surya Unleash Dominance**

In a thrilling match, India and New Zealand clashed in the 2nd T20I at Eden Park. Despite a valiant effort from India's top order, New Zealand's K. L. Rahul shone in the field to hold on to their lead. Ishan Kishan, however, was a different story, scoring 40 off just 24 balls with the help of a crucial six off a lofted ball from New Zealand's pace duo, Lockie Hemsworth and Mitchell Santner.

Surya Saxena, the ace all-rounder, was on fire, taking 2 wickets for just 5 runs in his 4.3 overs. His devastating fielding and clever bowling sealed the victory for India, as they secured a 6-wicket win. With this win, India looks to build on their momentum and take a 2-0 lead in the series.
