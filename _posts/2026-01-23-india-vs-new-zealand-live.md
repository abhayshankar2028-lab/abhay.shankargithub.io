**India vs New Zealand Live Cricket Score: 2nd T20**

The highly anticipated 2nd T20 between India and New Zealand is underway in Raipur, with the home team looking to bounce back from a loss in their previous match. The playing XI for India is as follows: Rohit Sharma (c), Rishabh Pant, Rilee Rossouw, Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, and Jasprit Bumrah.

On the other hand, the Kiwi squad consists of Kane Williamson (c), Tom Latham, Martin Guptill, Mitchell Santner, Trent Boult, and Adam Zampa. The toss for the game was won by New Zealand, with their batting unit putting up a strong show earlier in the game. India's batting lineup has been looking promising, with Ishan Kishan and Rishabh Pant in focus, while the bowling attack needs to step up to contain the Kiwis' aggressive batting. The match could get intense as the teams look to secure a win.
