In a bizarre incident, Bengal captain Manish Pancholi's mistake has left the cricketing world stunned. During a Ranji Trophy match against Andhra Pradesh, Pancholi was seen leaving the crease to grab a drink from the sidelines. In a split second, he misjudged the trajectory of the ball and was caught off a delivery from Andhra's Venkateswaram, which bounced just inches from his feet. The umpire's call was immediate, and Pancholi was sent back to face the ball, only to be caught trying to play a defensive shot. The incident has raised eyebrows, with many fans questioning how such a mistake could have slipped through. "I thought he was safe, but the umpire's call was spot on," said a neutral observer.
