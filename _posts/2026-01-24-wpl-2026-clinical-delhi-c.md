**WPL 2026: Delhi Capitals Flip the Script with Dominating Performance**

In a thrilling match, the Delhi Capitals pulled off a clinical 7-wicket victory over Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Women's Premier League 2026. The Capitals' batting lineup, led by Tammy Beaumont, played a stellar innings to post an impressive total of 119/3. Delhi's spin bowling duo, Harleen Dala and Shabnam Sanjna, were instrumental in restricting RCB's run-scoring, particularly in their powerplay. RCB's captain, Mithali Raj, and Harleen's partner, Anuja Patil, put up a gritty effort but ultimately fell short of the mark. The win marks Delhi's first WPL title and cements their position as the top contenders in the tournament. With this victory, the Capitals have set the stage for a potential title showdown with their next opponents, Royal Chvolgers.
