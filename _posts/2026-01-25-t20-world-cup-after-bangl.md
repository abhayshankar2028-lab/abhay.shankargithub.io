**T20 World Cup Update: Scotland Prepares for India Showdown**

The T20 World Cup is just around the corner, and the stage is set for the tournament's knockout stages. After a dramatic exit from the tournament, Bangladesh has been knocked out by Scotland, sending them packing from India early. The Scottish team has been busy acclimatizing to the Indian climate, making sure they are prepared for the grueling cricket that lies ahead. With their performance in the tournament, Scotland can now focus on the Indian stage, where they will face off against a strong Indian team in the quarterfinals. The Indian team, known for their impressive batting line-up, will not be easy to defeat, but Scotland's experienced players will have the advantage of having played in high-pressure situations before. The stage is now set for an exciting quarterfinal showdown.
