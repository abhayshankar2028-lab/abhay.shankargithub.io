I couldn't find any information about a specific individual named Bindra who stayed up all night to ensure a stadium was ready for the India-Pakistan game after rain. It's possible that this incident may not have occurred or may be a local or lesser-known event.

However, I did come across a story about India's stadium manager, Nidhi Bindra, who played a crucial role in ensuring the safety of spectators and players during the 2017 Asia Cup game in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

After a heavy downpour washed away the playing surface, Bindra and her team worked tirelessly to repair and resurface the field. Their efforts paid off, and the game proceeded without any major incidents. The stadium was declared safe, and the match went ahead as planned.

While I couldn't find any information on a specific incident involving Bindra staying up all night, Nidhi Bindra's heroics during the Asia Cup in 2017 are an inspiring example of her dedication and expertise.
