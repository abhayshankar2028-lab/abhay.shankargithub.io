Nat Sciver-Brunt's cricketing career is a remarkable success story. However, there's a key aspect of her journey that sets her apart from other players - her decision to take wickets at a time when it was considered unusual. Unlike many of her contemporaries, Sciver-Brunt didn't feel compelled to replicate the likes of Mithali Raj and Vaniya Sharma by getting out. Instead, she focused on developing her bowling skills and taking wickets in a more traditional 90s-style way. This approach paid off, as Sciver-Brunt went on to become one of the most prolific wicket-takers in county cricket. Her unique approach to cricket has made her a role model for young bowlers around the world, showing that it's never too late to develop your skills and take wickets in a way that's genuine to you.
