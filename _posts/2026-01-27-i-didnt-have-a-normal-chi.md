I didn't have a normal childhood. My father was young and I lost him when I was just a kid. I saw my mother working as a maid to support our family. It was a tough time, but she did it with love and dedication. She sacrificed everything for me and my brother. I don't know what I would have done if anything had happened to her. She was the rock of our family, and I owe a lot of my success to her. Despite the challenges we faced, she always believed in me and pushed me to pursue my dreams. I'm grateful for the sacrifices she made for me and the lessons I learned from her. It wasn't easy, but it made me the person I am today.
