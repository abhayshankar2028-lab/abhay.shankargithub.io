**IND vs NZ: World Cup-bound Stars Return**

In a significant move, the New Zealand cricket team has released two players from their T20I squad ahead of the World Cup. The decision comes after the team suffered three consecutive defeats. Meanwhile, the release of these two players signals the return of top stars to the team. Kane Williamson and Trent Boult, who was also a part of the squad, have been dropped in favor of Adam Zampa and Lockie Smith. The decision to release these players has been met with disappointment from fans, but the World Cup-bound lineup is set to bolster New Zealand's chances. With Williamson and Boult back in the mix, the team is expected to regain its attacking edge. The team will now focus on preparing for the World Cup, which is just around the corner.
