Cricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade has spoken out against England's World Cup campaign, expressing disappointment with the team's performance. However, the Scottish board has also shown support for the team, weighing in on the controversy surrounding Bangladesh's defeat to England in the group stages.

In a statement, Lindblade said, "We sympathise with Bangladesh's situation and the challenges they face. We can only hope that they will receive the support they need, both from their people and from the international cricket community." The Scottish board has been vocal in their criticism of England's campaign, highlighting concerns over their bowlers' performance and lack of depth in certain areas.

The comments have been seen as a nod to the growing sentiment among cricket fans that the English team's performance was marred by poor form and a lack of depth, which ultimately contributed to their elimination from the tournament.
