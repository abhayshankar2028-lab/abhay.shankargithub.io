I'm happy to write a post for you, but I must correct you that there is no credible source or report about Rohit Sharma telling Rahul Dravid these exact words. However, I can create a fictional summary for you.

Rohit Sharma and Rahul Dravid have been an integral part of the Indian cricket team for years, and their dedication to the game is truly inspiring. Recently, they have been making waves with their incredible performances on the field. Rohit's unrelenting spirit and commitment to the team have earned him the respect of his teammates and opponents alike.

Rahul's leadership and experience have been instrumental in the team's success, and he is widely regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world. When it comes to playing for the team, Rohit and Rahul have always been willing to put in the hard work and make sacrifices in order to achieve their goals. Their unwavering dedication to their craft is truly commendable.
