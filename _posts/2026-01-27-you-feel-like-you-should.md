**You Feel Like You Should Be There: Ravi Bishnoi on Being Dropped from the Indian Team**

In a candid interview, former Indian team captain Ravi Bishnoi opened up about his experience being dropped from the national team.

He expressed his disappointment and frustration, stating that it was a "betrayal" from the team and the selectors.
