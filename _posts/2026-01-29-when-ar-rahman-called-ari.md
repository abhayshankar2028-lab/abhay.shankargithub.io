![When AR Rahman called Arijit Singh ‘reckless’ and said he is proud of him: ‘He works from his village’:](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/01/Arijit-Singh-AR-Rahman-.jpg)

I couldn't find any information or credible sources indicating that AR Rahman called Arijit Singh 'reckless' or said he is proud of him. It's possible that this is a false rumor or a misquote.

However, I did find that Arijit Singh has been a vocal advocate for social causes and has been involved in various charity projects. He has also been praised for his philanthropic efforts, particularly in the areas of education and healthcare.

AR Rahman is a renowned music composer and singer, known for his work in Bollywood and beyond. He has collaborated with numerous artists, including Arijit Singh, and has been recognized with numerous awards for his contributions to music. While opinions may vary, it's essential to respect individuals' choices and actions, especially when it comes to their professional and personal lives.
