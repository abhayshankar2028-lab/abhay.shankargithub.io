Former Pakistan cricketers have expressed their concern over Australia's depleted squad for the upcoming series. In a recent interview, Azhar Khan, a renowned Pakistani cricketer, questioned the seriousness of the Australian team's preparations. "It's as if they are fulfilling their formality to play a series," Khan said. "They don't seem to be taking the series seriously, unlike in the past. They are more focused on showcasing their squad rather than giving a true account of themselves." This sentiment is echoed by other former Pakistan players, who feel that the Australian team's performance in the series will be a reflection of their seriousness and intent rather than any talent or skill. The concern is palpable, and it remains to be seen how the Australian team will fare against the formidable Pakistani squad.
