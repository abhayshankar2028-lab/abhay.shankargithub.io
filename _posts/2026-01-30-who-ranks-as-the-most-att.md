**The Unstoppable Force: Who Reigns Supreme in T20s?**

In the realm of T20 cricket, the likes of Lasith Malinga and Jasprit Bumrah are often considered among the most destructive pacers. However, when pitted against each other, it's a different story altogether. Lasith Malinga, the Sri Lankan legend, has been known for his ability to swing the ball in both ways and at incredible speeds, making him a force to be reckoned with. His ability to bowl a wicket every 2.5 overs is a testament to his skill. On the other hand, Jasprit Bumrah, the Indian pacer, has been instrumental in the Mumbai Indians' success, with his ability to swing the ball in both ways and at high speeds making him a nightmare for batsmen. While both are incredibly talented, Lasith Malinga's sheer speed and ability to bowl a wicket every 2.5 overs gives him a slight edge over Jasprit Bumrah in the T20 attacking pacer category.
