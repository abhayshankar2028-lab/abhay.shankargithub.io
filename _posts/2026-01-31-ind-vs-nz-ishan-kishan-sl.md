Ishan Kishan made history yesterday as he became the first Indian batsman to score a T20I century in his maiden match against New Zealand. The 24-year-old left-arm orthodox spinner opened the innings for India and played a crucial role in their 8-wicket victory. With the ball flying back into the bowler's hands, Kishan unleashed a blistering 78-run partnership with Rishabh Pant, putting India in a commanding position. Pant and Kishan then combined to take out New Zealand's attack, with Kishan scoring a stunning 50 off 44 deliveries. His maiden century will go down in history as one of the most memorable moments in T20I cricket. India's victory marked a turning point in their series, and Kishan's impressive display cemented his place as a future Big-Boy of Indian cricket.
