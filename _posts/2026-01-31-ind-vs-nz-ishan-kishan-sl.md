Ishan Kishan has scripted history in the fifth T20I match between India and New Zealand, becoming the first Indian batsman to not only score a century but also take a maiden century in the format. In a thrilling chase, Kishan smashed 108 runs off 60 balls, including 15 fours and 5 sixes. New Zealand's Trent Boult struggled to contain the Indian pacers, while Kane Williamson's innings was cut short due to injury. Kishan's incredible display has catapulted India to the top of the ICC T20I rankings. This win has also marked a significant milestone in his career, as he becomes the youngest player to reach a century in T20Is. Kishan's performance is a testament to his exceptional batting skills and has cemented his place in the Indian team's ranks.
