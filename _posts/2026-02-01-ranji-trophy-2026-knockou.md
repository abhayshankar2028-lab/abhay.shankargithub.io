I'm happy to provide you with the latest news on the Ranji Trophy 2026 knockout schedule. However, as it appears I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time information and the information I provide is based on my training data, which is up to 2022.

That being said, I can suggest some possible sources where you can find the latest information on the Ranji Trophy 2026 knockout schedule, including the qualified teams and quarterfinal matches. Some popular cricket news websites, like ESPN Cricinfo, Cricket India, or The ESPN Cricinfo blog, may have the latest updates on the tournament schedule.

Please note that the schedule is subject to change, and I encourage you to check the official websites or social media channels of the Ranji Trophy 2026 for the most up-to-date information. I'll do my best to provide general information and updates, but I won't be able to provide the exact schedule or details of the matches.
