In a thrilling semifinal match, India edged out arch-rivals Pakistan to reach the last four of the U-19 World Cup. Despite not quite living up to expectations, India's young talent and determination saw them outscore Pakistan by 13 runs. The Indian team's captain, Shreyas Iyer, was instrumental in steering his team to victory, while Pakistan's Mohammed Shahid and Haris Sohail provided a solid fightback. However, it was India's pace bowling that proved decisive, with Ishan Kishan and Manish Pandey taking key wickets to seal the win. This impressive performance has catapulted India to the semifinals, where they will face off against a tough opponent. The Indian team's grit and resilience have been on full display, and they are now one step closer to lifting the trophy.
