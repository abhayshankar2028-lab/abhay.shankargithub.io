**Border 2 Box Office Collection Day 10: Sunny Deol's Powerhouse Hit Continues to Dominate**

In a week that has seen several Bollywood blockbusters stall, Sunny Deol's "Border 2" has emerged as one of the biggest winners. With its latest outing, the film has not only managed to break the Rs 200 crore mark but has also seen a significant spike in its growth. The film's massive commercial success can be attributed to the immense popularity of the lead duo, Sunny Deol and Aditi Rao Hydari. The film's unique blend of action, drama, and romance has resonated with the audience, making it a home run for the makers. While "Dhurandhar" may have been a close contender, "Border 2" has proven itself to be a force to be reckoned with, and it's clear that Sunny Deol's magnum opus is here to stay.
