In a major boost to their T20 World Cup aspirations, Sri Lanka's co-hosts have announced their final 15-man squad for the tournament. The team, which will face England in the opener of the Group A stage, boasts a formidable lineup that includes Virat Kohli, Kusal Mendis, Dhanushka Gunathilaka, and Bhanuka Sudan. Mustafizur Rahman, Roshan Mithun, and Mahesh Thakur are also part of the squad. The inclusion of spin bowlers Nishan Gunathanga and Sohajit Singh in the final 15-man lineup is a significant morale booster for the team. With a strong batting lineup and a good balance of experience and youth, Sri Lanka is looking to upset the odds and make a deep run in the tournament.
