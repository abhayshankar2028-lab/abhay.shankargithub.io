**Bent-Arm, Zig-Zag Action: Pakistan Spinners' Tactics Under Fire**

In a world where spin bowling is all about deception and strategy, Pakistan's right-arm spinners have been using a unique technique that has raised eyebrows in the cricketing community. Their bent-arm, zig-zag action with a long pause at the top of the run rates has been widely questioned. While the technique may be effective in getting batsmen out, it has also been deemed illegal by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The ICC's laws state that any action that "deceived the opponent or caused unnecessary distraction" is not allowed. Pakistan's spinners have been accused of deliberately bending their arms and using their long pauses to confuse and intimidate batsmen. However, the ICC has not taken any action against them as of now, leaving the spinners to continue using this tactic.
