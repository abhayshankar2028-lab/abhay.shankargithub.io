In a stunning turn of events, India's Harbhajan Singh has reacted strongly to Pakistan's decision to boycott India's T20 World Cup match. Speaking at a press conference, Harbhajan expressed his shock and disappointment at the sudden move, stating, "They didn't have a problem earlier." When questioned about the reason behind Pakistan's boycott, Harbhajan criticized the Pakistan cricket board for their actions, calling them "inconsiderate" and "unprofessional." He went on to say, "We have been friends for a long time, but sometimes you have to take decisions for the country, not for the friendship." Harbhajan's harsh words have come as a surprise, as Pakistan had previously expressed their intention to boycott the tournament. The incident has sparked a lively debate in the cricket world, with many questioning the Pakistan cricket board's decision.
