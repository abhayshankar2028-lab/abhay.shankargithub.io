I couldn't find any information on an individual named Abhishek Sharma associated with the city of Amritsar in relation to cricket or kulchas and kites. It's possible that this person or event does not exist.

However, I can suggest a re-write of the post:

"Amritsar: Where Cricket Meets Culchas and Kites

Amritsar, the historic city in the Punjab region of India, is a city that seamlessly blends traditional Indian culture with modern cricket. Visitors to Amritsar can experience the unique blend of food, music, and sports that defines this city. One of the must-try dishes in Amritsar is the kulcha, a type of flatbread that is often served with a variety of curries. Cricket is also an integral part of Amritsar's culture, with the city hosting numerous cricket matches throughout the year, including the famous Amritsar Test cricket match.

While Amritsar is not as well-known for kites as some other cities, the city's skies are filled with colorful kites that soar high into the air. Visitors can take a stroll along the famous Durgiana Temple, where they can enjoy the vibrant views of the surrounding countryside and the kite festival that takes place during the summer months."
