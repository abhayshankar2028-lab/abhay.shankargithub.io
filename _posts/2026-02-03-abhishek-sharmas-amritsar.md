In the heart of Punjab, lies the city of Amritsar, a place where cricket meets tradition. Abhishek Sharma, a local entrepreneur, has transformed the city's Amritsar Cricket Ground into a hub of cultural fusion. The stadium, once a humble venue for local cricket matches, has now become a vibrant spot for kulchas (puffed bread) and kites. On matchdays, fans gather to indulge in the city's specialty snacks, while also taking in the breathtaking views of the city's iconic Golden Temple.

Sharma's initiative has not only brought cricket back to the city, but has also put Amritsar on the culinary map. The stadium now hosts cultural events, such as the famous kulcha-baking competition, which has become an integral part of the city's festival calendar. With Sharma's vision, Amritsar has become a city that seamlessly blends its love for cricket with its rich cultural heritage.
