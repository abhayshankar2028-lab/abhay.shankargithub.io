**MCC Overhauls Laws to Improve Game of Cricket**

The governing body of cricket, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), has made significant changes to the Laws of Cricket in an effort to improve the game. One of the key updates is the increase in the number of overs from 20 to 30 in red-ball matches. This change aims to reduce the time spent in the field and encourage batters to play more aggressively. Additionally, the MCC has introduced new rules to prevent bowlers from using slow deliveries, including the "treat" ball, which is designed to be slower than normal pace. The changes are part of a broader effort to enhance the game's pace and unpredictability. These updates will be implemented for the upcoming season, with all changes taking effect at the start of the 2024-25 domestic competitions.
