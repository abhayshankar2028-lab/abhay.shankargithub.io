In a shocking move, Pakistan has announced that they will boycott today's T20 World Cup match against India at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. This decision comes in response to India's decision to limit the number of catchers allowed in the field. Former England player, David Gower, has expressed his disappointment and frustration with the move. "For India, that's a disaster," Gower said. "You can't just boycott a tournament and expect to win. It's not a game-changer. The teams that are actually competing will still have a chance to win. This decision will have a negative impact on the morale of the players and the team." Gower also criticized the decision to limit the number of catchers, suggesting that it may have an impact on the team's batting order.
