Ishan Kishan's comeback story is one for the ages. The talented wicket-keeper batsman made a triumphant return to international cricket after a two-year break, leading India to a stunning 8-wicket win over Australia in a Test match at the Nashik Stadium.

Kishan's incredible comeback was a testament to his hard work and dedication. Born and bred in Maharashtra, Kishan's childhood friends and cricketing mentors helped him push through his injury woes. His impressive display, featuring 114 runs and three crucial wickets, paid off in the end.

Kishan's achievement was a huge morale booster for the Indian team, which was on the brink of collapse. His fearless batting and exceptional fielding made him an invaluable asset to the team, and his comeback marked a turning point in India's 2023-24 tour of Australia.
