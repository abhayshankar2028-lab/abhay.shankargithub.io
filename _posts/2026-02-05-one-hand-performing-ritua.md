One hand performing rituals, other on phone: How Indian families are living the U-19 World Cup final

As the Indian U-19 World Cup final gets underway, families across the country are putting aside their worries and getting down to business. While many are glued to their phones, eagerly awaiting the match, others are performing traditional rituals. For some, this means reenacting the iconic "chakka chakka" dance, passed down through generations, while for others, it's a sacred ritual involving the sacred fire.

In many Indian households, the atmosphere is electric as families gather around the TV, their faces lit only by the glow of screens. The air is electric with excitement as the young cricketers take to the field, their eyes fixed intently on the action unfolding before them. Amidst the chaos, it's clear that family is at the forefront of this moment, with traditions and rituals playing a significant role in making this moment special.
