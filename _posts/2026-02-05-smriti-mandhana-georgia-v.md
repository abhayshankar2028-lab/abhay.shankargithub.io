In a thrilling encounter at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Bengaluru, Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) emerged victorious against their arch-rivals, Delhi Capitals, to clinch their second Women's Premier League (WPL) title. Indian all-rounder Smriti Mandhana starred with her exceptional batting and fielding skills, while Australian leg-spinner Georgia Voll made a crucial impact with her impressive performance. Mandhana, who was instrumental in RCB's victory in the inaugural season of the WPL, continued her impressive form with an unbeaten 50* off 42 balls. The victory marks RCB's maiden WPL title and caps off an impressive performance by the team. This win also cements Mandhana's position as one of the top players in the women's cricket circuit. With this win, RCB will look to defend their title in the upcoming season.
