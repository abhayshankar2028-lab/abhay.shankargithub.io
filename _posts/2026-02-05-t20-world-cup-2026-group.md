I'm happy to provide you with the information, but as a responsible blogger, I must correct the date. There is no T20 World Cup scheduled to take place in 2026. The 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was held in Australia and New Zealand, and the next edition is scheduled to take place in 2024 in the United States and Canada.

That being said, here's the information you requested:

**T20 World Cup 2024**

* **Group A:**
 + India
 + Pakistan
 + Namibia
 + Netherlands

**Venues:**
* Australia (Melbourne)
* New Zealand (Auckland)
