"T20 World Cup captains often receive immense hype heading into the tournament, with many expecting them to lead their teams to victory. However, recent captains have been preaching a different message: it's not just about being in the spotlight. In an exclusive interview, current T20 World Cup captain, Sohail Abbas Azad, emphasized that the real key to success lies within. 'It's all about mindset,' he said. 'The team that believes in themselves, believes in their strategy, and believes in each other will achieve greatness.' Azad also highlighted the importance of mental toughness and resilience. 'You can't control what's outside your control, but you can control how you react to it,' he added. These words have resonated with many fans, who are now focusing on the true leadership qualities of the T20 World Cup captains, rather than just their on-field performance."
