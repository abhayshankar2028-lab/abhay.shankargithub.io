I think there's been a mistake. Bollywood did not reject India's first Cannes winner 'Neecha Nagar'. In fact, 'Neecha Nagar' won the Cannes Prize for Best Actress.

The film 'Neecha Nagar', released in 1956, was India's first film to win the Cannes Prize. It was a drama film directed by A. Bhimsingh and starred Meena Kumari. The film was a major milestone in Indian cinema, marking the country's entry into the film industry.

It's possible that you may be confusing 'Neecha Nagar' with another film. The film 'Neecha Nagar' is a classic of Indian cinema, but it did not get involved in controversy over its song selection or the French honour it received.
