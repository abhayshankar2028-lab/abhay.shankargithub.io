In a thrilling finale, India emerged victorious against England in the sixth Under-19 World Cup final, securing a commanding 100-run victory. The Indian team, led by wicketkeeper-batsman Manish Pandey, employed a solid strategy to restrict England's big-hitting duo, Moeen Ali and Jos Buttler, while their own spinners, Saurabh Tiwary and Rishabh Pant, wreaked havoc on the English middle order. As a result, England's 181-run target proved insurmountable, with India finishing on a perfect 201/0. This sixth title for India makes them the most successful team in the Under-19 World Cup history. Pandey's century was instrumental in the victory, while Harshdeep Singh and Shreyas Iyer also played crucial roles. This triumph cements India's status as one of the world's top U-19 teams, with a legacy already cemented in the history books.
