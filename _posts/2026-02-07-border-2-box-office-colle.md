"Border 2 Box Office Collection: Day 15 Update

The wait is over, folks! The highly anticipated Bollywood film, Border 2, has reached its 15th day at the box office. And what a day it's been! Despite being a Sunny Deol starrer, the movie has somehow managed to record its lowest earning day so far.

According to the latest update, Border 2 has collected a whopping Rs 2.85 crore on the 15th day of its release. While it's a respectable amount, it's clear that the movie is struggling to find its footing. The film's box office performance has been inconsistent, and it's unclear if it will be able to recover its losses. Fans are still holding out hope that Border 2 will turn around its fortunes in the coming weeks."
