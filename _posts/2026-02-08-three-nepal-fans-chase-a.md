In a heartwarming display of dedication and perseverance, three Nepalese fans embarked on a 30-plus hour journey to chase their cricketing dreams. Living and working abroad, these individuals had been following the T20 World Cup for years, but their ultimate goal was to witness the tournament in person. Armed with nothing but a backpack, a dream, and a desire to cheer on their team, they set out on the arduous train ride. Four months later, they made it to the venue, where they were rewarded with two thrilling matches, one of which was exact replica of the final. Their unwavering support and camaraderie inspired others to chase their own cricketing ambitions. As they celebrated with fellow fans, their journey served as a testament to the power of hope and unity in the pursuit of a dream.
