I couldn't find any information or credible sources confirming the statement made by Vikrant Massey about being never part of the Ramayana film. However, I did find out that Vikrant Massey has denied being involved in the film, and sources close to the project have confirmed that Raghav Juyal has been cast in the role of Rama.

It appears that Vikrant Massey has dismissed recent rumors of him being replaced by Raghav Juyal, and has issued a statement denying any involvement in the film. This comes after reports emerged suggesting that the film's director, Ram Gopal Varma, was considering replacing Vikrant Massey with Raghav Juyal. While the authenticity of these reports is unclear, it's essential to note that no official confirmation has been made by the filmmakers or the cast.
