In a shocking move, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have been demoted to the lower rungs of the Indian cricket hierarchy. As per the latest BCCI contract list, the two former captain's ranks have been demoted to Grade A players. This decision has been taken after two consecutive disappointing performances in Test cricket. The duo's batting form has been a major concern, and their inability to get back into the form has led to their demotion. Meanwhile, other notable players like Ravindra Jadeja and Bhuvneshwar Sharma have been promoted to Grade A. The decision to demote Sharma and Kohli is a clear indication that the BCCI is still keen on grooming younger talent. It remains to be seen how the players will respond to this setback and work their way back up the ranks.
