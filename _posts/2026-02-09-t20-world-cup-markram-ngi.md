**South Africa Stuns Canada in T20 World Cup Thriller**

In a dominating display, South Africa secured a resounding 72-run victory over Canada in the T20 World Cup on Day 3 at SuperSport Park. Mark Smith's 52 off 46 balls was the standout performance, but it was Faf du Plessis and Heinrich Klaasen who proved to be the key factors in the Proteas' victory. The pair added 64 runs for the first wicket, with du Plessis taking 2 catches and Klaasen taking 1 catch to dismiss the Canadian opener. South Africa's bowlers then sealed the deal with a couple of tight overs, dismissing Canada's middle order. This win moves South Africa to the top of the T20 World Cup standings, as they now have 2 wins and 0 losses. The match was a thrilling one, but South Africa's superior batting line-up ultimately won out.
