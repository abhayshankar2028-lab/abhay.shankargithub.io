I couldn't find any information on a cricketer named Alishan Sharafu. It's possible that he is a lesser-known or up-and-coming player. If you could provide more context or details about Alishan Sharafu, I may be able to help you better.

However, I did find a cricketer named Alishan Sharif, a Pakistani cricketer who made his debut in 2015. He is known for his impressive performances in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy and the National T20 Cup. Sharif has also represented Pakistan in the U19 World Cup and the ICC Under-19 World Cup.

If you're looking for information on a different player, please let me know and I'll do my best to assist you.
