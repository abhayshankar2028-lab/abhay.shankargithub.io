Pakistan is gearing up for their high-stakes clash against India in the T20 World Cup, and they've started to find their rhythm. In a comprehensive 51-run win over the United States, they showcased their attacking brand of cricket. The star-studded Pakistan team, led by Babar Azam, dominated the proceedings, with Shadab Afridi and Hasan Ali taking crucial wickets. In a dominant display, Pakistan's batsmen scored at a blistering rate, with Fakhar Azam scoring a blistering 53 off just 38 balls. The US team, despite a valiant effort, struggled to contain the destructive Pakistani attack. This win has not only boosted their confidence but also given them a fighting chance against India in the tournament. With Pakistan on the rise, will India be able to contain their momentum? Only time will tell.
