BREAKING: India and India take on Pakistan in the highly anticipated T20 World Cup clash today. But before the main event, let's take a look at the pre-game excitement - Pakistan rode to a comprehensive 62-run victory over the USA in a thrilling match. Opener Babar Azam scored an unbeaten 29, while Fawad Alam and Haris Rauf chipped in with valuable contributions. The Pakistani bowlers were equally impressive, picking up 10 wickets in the process. The USA's Aamer Rauf and Ben Doolittle were the only batsmen to stay in the game, but ultimately fell to the Pakistani attack. This win has set the tone for the rest of the tournament, and we can't wait to see how India respond in their clash with their arch-rivals. Will the World Cup stage be set for a thrilling India-Pakistan showdown? Only time will tell.
