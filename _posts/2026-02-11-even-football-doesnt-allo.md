Pakistan's Usman Tariq has sparked controversy after being involved in a high-speed and unusual action that has left fellow cricketers from the Indian Premier League (IPL) debating its validity. During a recent match, Tariq zoomed past several fielders to clip the edge of a ball and score a boundary. However, some Indian cricket experts and former players have questioned the legality of the action, citing that it may have been considered a "bouncer" rather than a full-length delivery.

"I'm not convinced that it was a full bouncer," said Rohit Sharma, a former Indian cricketer. "Usman's actions look a bit too quick and slick. If it's not a bouncer, then it's not a boundary." Tariq's unconventional action has sparked a heated debate among cricket enthusiasts, with some defending his right to play the shot and others questioning the validity of his action.
