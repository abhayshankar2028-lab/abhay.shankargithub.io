Usman Tariq's impressive bowling skills have caught the attention of Indian batsmen, and it's clear that he's a force to be reckoned with. During his recent Test series against India, Tariq proved that he can be effective against the Indian top-order batsmen. His ability to pick up wickets, particularly against the likes of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, has raised concerns for the Indian team. Tariq's bowling style, which combines pace and swing, makes him a difficult target for the Indian batsmen to face. With many Indian batsmen facing questions about their ability to handle pressure, Tariq's performance has only added to the concerns. As the series continues, it's likely that Tariq will be a key factor in India's batting lineup, and his ability to deliver under pressure will be crucial in determining the outcome of the series.
