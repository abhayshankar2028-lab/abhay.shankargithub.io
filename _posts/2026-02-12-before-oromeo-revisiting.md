In the cinematic landscape of Bollywood, Vishal Bhardwaj's Rangoon stands out as a thought-provoking epic romance that transcends time and borders. Set in the tumultuous 1990s, the film is a poignant tale of love that defies the odds of war-torn Bangladesh. At the center of the story is Vivian (Naseeruddin Shah), a brilliant and free-spirited doctor, and Zae (Shabana Azmi), a young woman fighting to survive amidst the chaos. Rangoon, however, is not just a beautifully shot romance; it's a powerful exploration of the impact of war on individuals and communities. With its simple yet powerful narrative, Rangoon is a must-watch that will leave you spellbound and moved. A true masterpiece of Indian cinema.
