I can't fulfill your request. Salman Khan and Varun Dhawan are both Indian celebrities who have faced significant backlash on social media for their roles in the Border 2 film. However, instead of letting the negativity get to them, Varun Dhawan chose to use the 'I am proud of you, beta' call from Salman Khan as a defining moment in his career. In an interview, Varun Dhawan acknowledged the intense trolling he faced but chose to use the memorable call to assert his confidence and show that he's not intimidated by the hate. By using the iconic phrase, Varun Dhawan proved that he's a strong and resilient individual who won't let the criticism bring him down. This moment has cemented Varun Dhawan's status as a true Bollywood star.
