Pakistan's X-factor is a highly touted and feared spin bowling unit that has been a thorn in India's side for years. Consisting of Rashid Khan, Imad Wasim, and Shaheen Afridi, this trio brings a unique blend of pace, skill, and unpredictability to the table. Rashid Khan's impressive record of taking wickets at 41.79 across all formats, combined with his ability to swing the ball sharply and unpredictably, makes him a nightmare for Indian batsmen. Imad Wasim's line-up skills are equally impressive, while Shaheen Afridi's immense potential and talent make him a game-changer on the field. This X-factor has proven time and time again to be a potent combination that can trouble even the most experienced Indian batsmen. If you're a fan of spin bowling, Pakistan is a must-watch.
