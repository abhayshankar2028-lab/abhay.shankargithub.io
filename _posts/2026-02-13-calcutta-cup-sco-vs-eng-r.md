The Calcutta Cup is more than just a rugby match, it's a battle of pride and prestige. The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) and the England Rugby Union (ERU) have been locked in a fierce rivalry for years, with the Calcutta Cup serving as the ultimate prize in the Autumn Internationals series. The Scotsmen have been gaining momentum in recent years, with victories over the likes of Wales and Ireland. The ERU, however, will stop at nothing to reclaim the Cup, and their lads will be determined to add it to their already impressive collection. It's a rivalry that goes beyond just rugby, with both teams bringing their A-game every time they step onto the pitch. It's a clash of cultures, with the Scots embracing their Celtic heritage and the ERU embodying the English spirit. The stage is set for an epic showdown, and the winner will take home the coveted Calcutta Cup.
