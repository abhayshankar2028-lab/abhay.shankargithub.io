Mohammed Siraj, the Indian fast bowler, has been teasing Arshdeep Singh on social media about his reaction to being caught trying to run out the batsman. In a recent match, Singh was seen trying to run out Virat Kohli, but was caught by the bowler instead. Siraj, known for his cheeky and humorous celebrations, took to Twitter to roast Singh, saying "Zyada jump le liya...". The tweet has sparked a heated debate among cricket fans, with some defending Singh's actions and others agreeing with Siraj's assessment. The exchange has also led to a few memes going viral, poking fun at both the bowler and the player. It's clear that Siraj is not afraid to speak his mind, and his tweet has certainly made a statement.
