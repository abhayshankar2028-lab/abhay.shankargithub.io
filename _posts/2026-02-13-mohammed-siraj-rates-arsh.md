In a recent match, Punjab Kings' pacer Mohammed Siraj took to the field to celebrate the wicket of their opponent, but his enthusiasm didn't quite translate to the pitch. As he walked back to the pavilion, he let out a loud 'Siuuu' that echoed across the stadium. However, rather than the usual celebratory tone, Siraj's 'Siuuu' took on a slightly different meaning. According to Siraj himself, the phrase "Zyada jump le liya" translates to "Too much jump, I fell". It seems Siraj's excitement got the best of him, and he ended up tumbling to the ground after taking the wicket. It's not often that you see a cricketer's celebration getting a bit too enthusiastic, but in this case, Siraj's enthusiasm was indeed a bit too much.
