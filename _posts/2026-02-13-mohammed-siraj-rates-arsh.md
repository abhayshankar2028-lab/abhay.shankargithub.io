In a recent match, Indian pace bowler Mohammed Siraj was seen celebrating his wicket by mimicking the famous 'Siuuu' gesture from former Punjab captain Harbhajan Singh. The crowd went wild as Siraj took to the field, and the fans couldn't help but laugh at his antics. When the umpire signaled for Siraj to finish his celebration, he enthusiastically exclaimed "Zyada jump le liya...". The phrase roughly translates to "So much jumping!" in English. Siraj's infectious laughter and exaggerated jumping motion seemed to have won over the fans, and many were left in stitches. It's clear that Siraj has unintentionally become a meme sensation, and fans are loving every minute of it. The 'Siuuu' celebration has become a laughing matter, and it's clear that Siraj will have to work on toning down his enthusiasm to avoid being too "jumpy"!
