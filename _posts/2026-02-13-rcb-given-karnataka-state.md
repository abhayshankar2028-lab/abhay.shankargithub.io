IPL 2026 is indeed scheduled to take place in Bengaluru, and it's been announced that the Karnataka state government has given its nod to RCB (Royal Challengers Bangalore) to host the matches at the iconic Chinnaswamy Stadium. This development is a significant boost for the local cricket community and fans, as it means that the team will get to play at one of the most iconic stadiums in Indian cricket. The Chinnaswamy Stadium, known for its electric atmosphere, has hosted many memorable matches in the past, and it's expected to play a crucial role in the IPL 2026 final.
