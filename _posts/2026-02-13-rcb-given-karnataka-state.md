RCB has been granted permission by the Karnataka state government to host the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2026 matches at the iconic Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. This development marks a significant milestone for the Karnataka government, which has been working to revamp the state's sports infrastructure. The Chinnaswamy Stadium, previously known as the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, has been the home of Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) for over a decade and has a seating capacity of over 67,000. The stadium's renovations are expected to be completed in time for the IPL 2026 season, ensuring that the matches are held at a state-of-the-art facility. This development is expected to boost the state's sports tourism industry, with numerous other matches and events also set to take place at the stadium in the near future.
