This Valentine's Day, as we celebrate love, let's not forget the toxic tropes that can ruin it for those who don't want it. In the realm of Bollywood, we've got five 'toxic tropes' to steer clear of.

Firstly, the 'obsessive love' trope, as seen in Kabir Singh, where one man's all-consuming passion is a recipe for disaster. Next, the 'petrol bombs' trope, where love becomes a violent, destructive force. We also can't ignore the ' passive-aggressive' trope, where one partner tries to drive the other away with subtle sabotage. The ' manipulative' trope, where one partner uses guilt or coercion to control the other is another. And let's not forget the 'unrealistic expectations' trope, where base expectations of a relationship can lead to disappointment. By recognizing and avoiding these toxic tropes, you can navigate Valentine's Day with a healthier, more positive relationship.
