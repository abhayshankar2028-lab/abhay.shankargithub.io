Pakistan's spinners have been dealt a debilitating blow with the arrival of Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya. The 29-year-old Indian sensation has been instrumental in the Indian team's success, boasting a phenomenal batting average and impressive statistics in both domestic and international cricket.

Pandya's arrival has thrown a significant challenge to Pakistan's spin bowling department, with their seam bowlers struggling to cope with his exceptional hand-eye coordination and unorthodox action. The likes of Shadab AT, Imran Tahir, and Wasim Akram have all faced significant difficulties in getting the ball to swing and seam, and will need to adapt quickly to keep pace with Pandya's skilful darts. Pakistan's bowling staff will need to regroup and come up with a new strategy to counter Pandya's threat, or risk falling behind in the series.
