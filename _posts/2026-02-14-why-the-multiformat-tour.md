As the multi-format tour to Australia approaches, the focus shifts to the Indian women's team, particularly Harmnapreet Kaur and her co-stars. The tour is a much-needed test for the unit, which has been dealing with the aftermath of the 2022 World Cup in India. With the Indian Premier League (IPL) just around the corner, the team needs to gel and work together seamlessly. The multi-format tour offers an opportunity for the team to test their skills against different conditions and opponents, which will help them build confidence and cohesion. Kaur and her co-stars, including Veda Krishnamurthy and Deepti Sharma, will have to navigate the varying pitches and conditions of Australia, which could be a real challenge. Will they rise to the test and show their mettle? Only time will tell.
