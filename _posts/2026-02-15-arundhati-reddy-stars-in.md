In a thrilling display, India secured their 5th win of the Aus tour with a resounding 8-wicket victory over Australia at the SCG in a rain-hit T20I on Sunday. Arundhati Reddy, the Indian middle-order batter, made her mark with a 38 off 53 deliveries, showcasing her skills despite the challenging conditions. The Australian bowlers struggled to contain Reddy, who was instrumental in her team's success. The match was eventually abandoned due to continuous rain, and India's performance was left to be judged. Despite the tough conditions, the Indian team showed remarkable resilience and determination. The win is a crucial boost to India's campaign, and they now look to build on this momentum as they prepare for the next match. Reddy's performance will be a key factor in India's future success.
