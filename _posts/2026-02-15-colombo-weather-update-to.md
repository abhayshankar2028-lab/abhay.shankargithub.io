![Colombo weather update today, India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup 2026: Will rain affect IND-PAK match today?](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/colombo-weather.jpg)

I'm happy to provide you with the information, but I must correct you that I'm not aware of any information about an upcoming match between India and Pakistan in the T20 World Cup 2026. However, I can provide you with an update on the current weather conditions in Colombo.

As of my knowledge cutoff, the weather in Colombo is generally pleasant, with average temperatures ranging from 28°C to 32°C (82°F to 90°F). However, there are always some chance of rain, especially towards the end of the day.

Given the unpredictability of weather conditions in tropical countries, it's difficult to predict whether the rain will affect the IND-PAK match today. It's essential to keep an eye on the local weather forecast before the match to get a more accurate prediction.

Please note that this is just an update based on my knowledge cutoff, and I'm not aware of any specific information about the match.
