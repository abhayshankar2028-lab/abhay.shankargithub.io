In a thrilling T20 World Cup match, Pakistan equalled their record with a scintillating 18 overs of spin bowling, but ultimately fell short against a formidable Indian attack in Colombo.

In the 45th over, Pakistan's spin trio of Haris Rauf, Shahid Afridi, and Umar Gul bowled an impressive 18 overs, claiming 24 wickets and restricting India to 162/8 in 18 overs. However, India's star batsman, Shikhar Dhawan, batted with his trademark brilliance, helping his team to post a commanding score of 189/3.

The match turned out to be a nail-biter, with India eventually extending their lead to 24 runs. The match will be remembered for the spin-filled display from Pakistan, as well as India's innings-Ending innings.
