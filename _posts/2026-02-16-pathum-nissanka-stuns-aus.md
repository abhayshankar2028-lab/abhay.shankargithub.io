I think you may have some incorrect information. 

There is no record of a Pathum Nissanka who was signed at a temple and delivered at the T20 World Cup. It's possible that you may be thinking of another cricketer or a different tournament.

However, I did find that Pathum Nissanka is a Sri Lankan cricketer who played in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL). He has also represented Sri Lanka in the ICC World Cup and the Asia Cup.

If you're looking for a post about a specific cricketer, I'd be happy to try and assist you. Alternatively, I can provide information on Sri Lankan cricketers or the T20 World Cup if you're interested.
