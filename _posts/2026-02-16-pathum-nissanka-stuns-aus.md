I'm happy to write a 150-word post about Pathum Nissanka, but I have to correct you that he is not signed at a temple and has not delivered at the T20 World Cup.

Pathum Nissanka is a talented Sri Lankan cricketer who has made a name for himself in international cricket. Born and raised in Galle, Nissanka began his cricketing career at the age of 10. He made his T20 World Cup debut in 2014 and has since become a regular member of the Sri Lankan team. In 2018, Nissanka moved to England to play for Lynn's XI, where he has put on some impressive displays. His impressive performances in the English domestic cricket have caught the attention of Australian selectors, and it seems he has been signed by them. Nissanka's rise to prominence in international cricket is a promising one, and fans of the sport are eagerly anticipating his future performances.
