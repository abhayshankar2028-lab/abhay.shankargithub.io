Ishan Kishan's calculated dismantling of Shaheen Afridi at the hands of the Indian middle-order batsman at the Pakistan Super League (PSL) has been widely praised by cricket commentators. The 25-year-old opener's aggressive approach to batting, combined with his ability to adapt to different conditions, proved too much for the Pakistan pacer. Shaheen, who has been one of the most successful fast bowlers in the PSL, was particularly exposed by Kishan's aggressive line and length variation. The former Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) coach, who has worked with many talented Indian players, has praised Kishan's skill and strategy. "Ishan's was a masterclass performance against Shaheen. He played with great finesse and took advantage of the Pakistani bowler's limitations," he said. Kishan's impressive display has solidified his position as one of the top batsmen in the Indian Premier League.
