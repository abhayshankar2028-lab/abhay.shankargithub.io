**India's Bowling Crisis: A Concerning Reality**

As India prepares to take on top-ranked teams in the ICC World Cup, a concerning reality has come to light. Mohammed Shami, one of the country's most reliable bowlers, is struggling to find form. While he has been a stalwart in India's bowling lineup, there is a concern that he may not have a like-for-like replacement.

Coach B. D. Siddiqui has acknowledged the issue, stating that finding a suitable replacement is a top priority. The current squad lacks a specific bowler with Shami's unique skillset, which makes it challenging to replace him. The Indian team needs to find a bowler who can offer a similar level of pace, swing, and spin to Shami. Until then, the onus may fall on other bowlers, including those in their 20s, to step up and fill the void.
