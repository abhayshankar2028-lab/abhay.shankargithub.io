England's T20 World Cup campaign was marred by disappointment for Nick Knight. The team's inability to maintain a consistent level of performance throughout the tournament was a major concern. In the group stage, they struggled to find a cohesive strategy, often changing their approach mid-match. This lack of planning led to a series of costly mistakes, including the batting collapse against New Zealand. Knight acknowledged that the team's loss of coherency was a major factor in their struggles. "We lost a plan, we lost our way," he said. "We didn't have a clear understanding of our strengths and weaknesses, and it showed. We need to work on our planning and execution if we want to succeed in this format." Ultimately, England's campaign ended with a disappointing exit from the competition.
