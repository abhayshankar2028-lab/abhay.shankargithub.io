England's historic T20 World Cup campaign has come to a disappointing end. Nick Knight, the team's vice-captain, has expressed his frustration with the England cricket team's inability to find coherency and a clear plan. Despite being one of the favourites to win the tournament, England found themselves struggling to adapt to different conditions and opponents throughout the group stage. The team's batting lineup, in particular, was plagued by inconsistency, with players struggling to find their rhythm against top-notch bowling attacks.

Knight felt that the team's lack of cohesion and planning ultimately cost them the series. "We lost coherency, lost a plan," he said. "We didn't know how to bat against different types of bowling, and we didn't know how to field against different types of opposition. We need to take responsibility for that and work on our game plan."
