In an interview with a popular cricket website, Pakistan's fast bowler Shadab Khan expressed his frustration with the snub he received from both Babar Azam and Shaheen Afridi towards him and his teammates. The Pakistan cricketers were praised for their impressive performances, particularly Babar Azam's impressive batting, and Shaheen Afridi's exceptional bowling. Shadab felt that both players were trying too hard to win and were more focused on being the star player than working together as a team. He emphasized that the real winning is not about individual accolades but about the team's success. Shadab urged the team to put aside their differences and work together to achieve their goals.
