In a recent interview, Pakistan's Shadab Khan expressed his frustration with the snub of Pakistan's vice-captain Babar Azam and fast bowler Shaheen Afridi. Khan stated, "You can't take things to heart. Everyone's trying to win. I am not surprised that Babar and Shaheen were left out of this tournament. They are both talented players, but they are not the ones who will lift the trophy."

Khan also hinted at the potential rivalry between Azam and Afridi, saying, "There's a lot of competition for the spot in the team, and I think there's a bit of a rivalry between Babar and Shaheen. But at the end of the day, it's not about who's best, it's about who's best suited for the team."

Khan's comments have sparked a lively debate on social media, with many fans defending Azam and Afridi's inclusion in the tournament.
