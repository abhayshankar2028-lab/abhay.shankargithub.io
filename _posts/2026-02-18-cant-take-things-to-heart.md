In a recent interview, Pakistani leg-spinner Shadab Khan opened up about the ongoing controversy surrounding Babar Azam and Shaheen Afridi's snub. The trio's omission from the Pakistan squad for the upcoming Asia Cup has sparked heated debates on social media. Shadab, however, maintains that they're not the ones trying to win, stating, "Everyone's trying to win." He further emphasized that the focus should be on playing good cricket, rather than individual accolades. The leg-spinner went on to express his respect for the team's management and opposition players, emphasizing that their success is what matters. Shadab's calm and collected demeanor has once again proved to be a valuable asset for the team, as he continues to navigate the complex world of international cricket.
