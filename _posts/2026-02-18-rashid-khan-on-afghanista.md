In a thrilling World Cup exit, Afghanistan's Rashid Khan reflected on the intense four-day battle they faced against two top teams. The young leg-spinner was one of the standout performers, taking 20 wickets at an incredible 10.66 runs per maiden over. Despite a valiant effort, Afghanistan was bowled out for 132 runs in their 50-over stint, leaving them reeling.

Khan attributed the defeat to the grueling schedule, stating, "We faced two top teams in four days. We knew it would be a tough fight, but we couldn't control the conditions." The tournament was undoubtedly a high-pressure environment, but Khan's impressive display on the field is a testament to his growing talent. As the country looks to rebuild and rebuild for future tournaments, Khan's performances will be a key consideration.
