**Exclusive Report: No Pakistani players in The Hundred franchises**

In a shocking revelation, a recent report has highlighted the stark contrast between Pakistan and India in the realm of cricket. The report, which has been confirmed by multiple sources, states that there are no Pakistani players participating in the inaugural franchises of The Hundred, a new English Twenty20 competition.

The inquiry, which was conducted by the International Cricket Council (ICC), revealed that India has an overwhelming presence in the league, with multiple teams competing for the coveted title. In stark contrast, Pakistan's participation has been relatively limited, with only a handful of players participating in the inaugural franchises.

The report raises significant questions about the lack of investment in Pakistani cricket by the international community. With the ICC's backing, many believe that Pakistan's cricketing prospects are on the decline. The situation highlights the stark contrast between the two nations in terms of cricketing investment and opportunities.
