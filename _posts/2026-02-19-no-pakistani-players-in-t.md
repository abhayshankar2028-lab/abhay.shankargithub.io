A recent report suggests that the Indian venture capital firm, KKR, has a significant stake in the franchises of the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises but no Pakistani players. The report, which was based on data from the IPL, stated that KKR's investment in the franchises is substantial, with a stake that is higher than the average investment of the other franchises. The report also stated that the Indian talent pool is the largest and most talented in the world, which is reflected in the high number of Indian players in the IPL. It is worth noting that KKR's investment is not limited to the IPL franchises, as they also have a stake in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) franchises. This suggests that the Indian cricketing community has a significant influence on the ownership and investment decisions of the IPL franchises.
