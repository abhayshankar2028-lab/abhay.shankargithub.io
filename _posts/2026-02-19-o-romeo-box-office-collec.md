"O Romeo, the highly anticipated Bollywood film, has finally hit the theaters, and the numbers are in. As of day 6, the movie has earned a whopping Rs 44 crore at the box office. Starring Shahid Kapoor and Vishal Bhardwaj, the film has been generating buzz for quite some time now. However, it seems that the anticipation has paid off, as the movie has finally crossed the Rs 40 crore mark. But, what's interesting to note is that the movie is trailing behind its competitor, Kaminey, which has been performing exceptionally well. In fact, Haider, the movie starring Shahid Kapoor, has also been performing very well, but it seems that the movie is not quite able to break free from its third place position. Despite this, O Romeo continues to hold its ground, and we can't wait to see what the rest of the week brings!"
