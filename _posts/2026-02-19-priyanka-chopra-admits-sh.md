Priyanka Chopra recently opened up about her journey in Hollywood, revealing that despite her success, she hasn't quite felt like she's "arrived" just yet. In an interview, she confessed that despite having fewer opportunities than her Indian counterparts, she hasn't felt like she's settled in the industry. "I may have had fewer opportunities... I've been in this industry for a while now," she said. Chopra acknowledged that her lack of opportunities may be a factor in her feelings of not having arrived. However, she remains optimistic, stating that she's "passionate" and "determined" to succeed. With her new husband Nick Jonas by her side, Chopra is certainly excited for her future in Hollywood. Despite her doubts, she's refusing to give up on her dreams, and we can't wait to see what the future holds for this talented actress.
