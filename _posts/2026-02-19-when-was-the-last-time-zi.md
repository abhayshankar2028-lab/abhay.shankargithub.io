Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information on Zimbabwe playing in India before the Super 8 stage of the 2026 T20 World Cup. However, I did find that Zimbabwe is scheduled to play in India in the upcoming 2023 ICC World Cup Qualifier.

The 2023 ICC World Cup Qualifier is a 10-team tournament that will be held in Zimbabwe, along with hosts India, from February 27 to March 17, 2023. This tournament serves as a qualifying route for the 2023 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, which will be held in Australia and New Zealand from October 16 to November 13, 2023.

Since the 2023 ICC World Cup Qualifier is scheduled before the Super 8 stage of the 2026 T20 World Cup, it is highly unlikely that Zimbabwe will make it to the Super 8 stage.
