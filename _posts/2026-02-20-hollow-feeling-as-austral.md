Australia's disappointing T20 World Cup campaign came to a heartbreaking end with a crushing 31-run win over Oman in the dead rubber. The final scorecard read 23/1 in 8 balls, with Australia's tail losing 2 wickets. The loss was a fitting end to a campaign that had been marked by inconsistency and disappointment. The defeat was a harsh message to the Australian team, who had been expected to perform better in the tournament. The team's captain, Moeen Ali, was particularly aggrieved by the loss, which was a major setback to Oman's hopes. The loss will serve as a reminder that in T20 cricket, a single mistake can be costly.
