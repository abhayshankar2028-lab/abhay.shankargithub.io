**T20 World Cup: Why India face fellow group-toppers in Super Eight**

The T20 World Cup is just around the corner, and India is gearing up to take on their fellow group-toppers in the Super Eight stage. As the only team in the playoffs, India's chances of making it to the final are, unfortunately, zero. According to the ICC's seeding rule, teams are ranked based on their World Cup performance, with the top teams receiving the top spot. This means that India, despite being one of the most successful teams in the tournament, will be facing off against Pakistan, Australia, and New Zealand, all of whom are currently in the top three.

This seeding rule often surprises fans and pundits alike, as teams that have not performed as well in the tournament may find themselves facing off against their more successful counterparts. Will India be able to turn the tables and make a deep run in the playoffs, or will they succumb to the pressure? Only time will tell.
