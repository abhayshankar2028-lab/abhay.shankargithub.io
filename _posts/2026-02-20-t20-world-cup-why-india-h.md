**T20 World Cup: Why India face tough Super Eight matchup**

The T20 World Cup, currently underway in Australia, has already presented an exciting challenge for India as they navigate the Super Eight stage. As the top-ranked team in the group, they will face off against fellow group-toppers, Pakistan and New Zealand. To understand why this is a tough matchup, let's delve into the seeding rule of the ICC.

The ICC has a unique seeding system that takes into account the teams' World Cup performance and head-to-head record against each other. As the top-ranked team, India is seeded first in the group, followed by the second-placed team and the third-placed team. This means they have a high chance of advancing to the Super Eight stage, but they will also face stiff competition from Pakistan and New Zealand.

It's going to be a closely contested Super Eight stage, and India will need to perform at their best to emerge victorious.
