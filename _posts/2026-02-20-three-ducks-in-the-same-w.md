"In a candid interview with ESPN Cricinfo, former India batter S. Sreesanth expressed his frustration with the way Abhishek Sharma has struggled to replicate his T20 success. The 31-year-old has failed to match the destructive batsmen of the likes of AB de Villiers and Chris Gayle, despite being a key player in India's 2021 T20 World Cup campaign. Sreesanth questioned Sharma's technique, suggesting that he relies too heavily on power and not enough on precision. 'Three ducks in the same way', Sreesanth quipped, referring to Sharma's tendency to swing the ball away from the batsman when it's not in his favor. Sreesanth also touched upon the issue of Sharma's batting position, stating that it's been an issue for a long time. The former batter believes that Sharma needs to work on his technique and find a balance between power and precision to become a top-class T20 batsman."
