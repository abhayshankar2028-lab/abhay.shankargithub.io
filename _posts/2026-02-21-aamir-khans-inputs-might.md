Aamir Khan, the renowned Bollywood actor, has been making headlines for years with his intense film reviews. However, his critics, including Kalpana Iyer, have been vocal about his alleged harsh criticism. "Aamir Khan's inputs might seem unfair or harsh at times, but he is very sincere," Iyer shared. When asked about the perception, Aamir himself humbly replied, "When people say I am very fussy, they don't know the passion and dedication that goes into creating a film." Iyer added, "I've worked with Aamir for several years, and I've never witnessed him being fussy. He is a perfectionist and wants the best for his films." Iyer's candid opinion highlights the complexity of Aamir's character, which can sometimes be misunderstood by the media and the public.
