In a recent match, Suryakumar Yadav was in the spotlight, scoring crucial runs to keep India's batting line-up in the mix. However, when asked about the expectations, the batsman remained calm and quoted a wise saying - "Expectation is to make 220, 240, 250. But wickets are a little different." This refreshing attitude is a testament to India's ability to adapt to different conditions, as evident in the match. The batters were able to navigate the tricky pitches, taking advantage of the spin and bounce to score crucial runs. This is a clear indication that India's batsmen are more than capable of performing under pressure, making them a formidable opponent in future matches.
