In a scathing attack, Bangladesh's assistant coach, Farhad Hossain, has expressed his discontent with the country's former sports advisor, Taslim Rahman. The duo was involved in a series of high-profile controversies, including a string of players expressing frustration with the team's management and game plan. Hossain took aim at Rahman, stating that the former advisor had "seriously damaged the team's morale" by his actions. "Players were mentally shattered," Hossain alleged, citing the impact of Rahman's decisions on the team's performance. The coach also accused Rahman of "manipulating" the players and making them feel "uncomfortable" during training sessions. This latest salvo from Hossain comes after Rahman stepped down from his position amidst growing criticism. The incident has cast a shadow over Bangladesh's cricket season, with many questioning the handling of the team by the new coaching staff.
