In an impressive display of cricketing prowess, Smriti Mandhana took center stage in Adelaide, as India thrashed Australia in their T20I leg by 53 runs. The Indian opening batswoman, known for her impressive batting skills, scored 28 runs off 38 balls, showcasing her remarkable technique and patience. However, it was her supporting act, Shikha Pandey, who stole the show with 31 runs off 27 balls, including a crucial six off a no-balled delivery. Together, Mandhana and Pandey formed a potent partnership, setting a formidable foundation for India's innings. Their display was a testament to the strength of India's batting lineup, which was led by their talented skipper, Harmanpreet Kaur. The victory marked a significant milestone in India's campaign, and Mandhana's performance was a highlight of the match.
