Smriti Mandhana continues to be an attacking force in T20Is, netting a crucial half-century in India's thrilling 5-wicket loss to Australia in Adelaide. The Indian middle-order batswoman was named the Man of the Match after a stellar display, which saw her contribute an impressive 60 not out off 45 deliveries. Her partnership with Sunaki Reddy and Shikha Pandey formed a potent attacking unit that took down the Australians. The Eagles ultimately fell to 181/6 in 19.3 overs, leaving India to seal the victory with three balls to spare. This victory marks a significant turnaround in India's T20I fortunes, as they now sit atop the rankings. Smriti Mandhana's impressive display has reaffirmed her position as one of the world's top T20I batswomen, and her partnership with Reddy and Pandey has provided a strong foundation for India's future success.
