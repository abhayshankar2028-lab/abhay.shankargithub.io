Smriti Mandhana made a memorable return to action as she spearheaded India's thrilling 6-wicket win over Australia in the T20I leg at Adelaide Oval. The Indian skipper, who had been out of form in the series, proved to be the difference between the two teams. With her attacking batting style, Mandhana chipped in with crucial support from her opening partner Renuka Prasad, who dominated the Australian bowlers with her sheer pace. The duo's partnership was instrumental in India's victory, and Mandhana's 21-ball 28 not out helped India secure a commanding lead. This win has given India a much-needed boost in the series, and Mandhana's impressive display will be remembered as a key factor in India's success. Mandhana's performance has once again highlighted her importance in the Indian team.
