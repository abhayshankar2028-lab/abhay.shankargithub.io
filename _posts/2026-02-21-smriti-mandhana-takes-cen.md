India's Smriti Mandhana shone to perfection in the T20I leg against Australia in Adelaide, securing a thrilling 54-run win for the Men in Blue. With her exceptional batting skills, Mandhana played a crucial role in the Indian victory, scoring 45 not out off 56 deliveries. Her partnership with Mithali Raj, who also scored 35, was instrumental in building a strong foundation for the Indian innings. 

In contrast, Australia's players, particularly Shreyas Iyer and Alex Carey, struggled to come to terms with the Indian bowling attack. Australia's star all-rounder, David Warner, was particularly disadvantaged, scoring just 8 runs off 16 deliveries. Mandhana's outstanding performance helped India secure a comfortable win, and she was named the Man of the Match. Her impressive display took her to the top of the Indian batting rankings.
