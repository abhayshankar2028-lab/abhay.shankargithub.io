As the T20 World Cup heats up, cricket fans are buzzing about the performances of several players. However, one player in particular has been making headlines for his unorthodox approach to the game. Abhishek Sharma, a former Indian opener, has been struggling with form, and some fans are worried about his chances in the tournament.

In an interview, former India captain Suryakumar Yadav has shared his thoughts on Sharma's performance. "Those who worry about Abhishek Sharma's form, I worry about them," Yadav said. "Sharma is a talented player, but he needs to focus on his game. If he can get his mind right and work on his weaknesses, he can be a threat to any team." With the T20 World Cup just around the corner, Sharma's fans are eagerly awaiting his next performance. Can he turn his form around and lead India to a sweet victory?
