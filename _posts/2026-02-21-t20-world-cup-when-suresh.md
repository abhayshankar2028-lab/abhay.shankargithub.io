**India's Historic First Centurion in T20 Cricket**

On February 17, 2007, a remarkable moment in Indian cricket history unfolded when Suresh Raina became the first Indian batsman to score a T20 century against South Africa. This achievement was significant as it marked a new era in T20 cricket, where the shortest format was gaining popularity worldwide. Raina's 101 runs against South Africa in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 semi-final cemented his status as a leading T20 batsman. This milestone not only boosted Indian cricket's presence in the international T20 circuit but also paved the way for future generations of Indian batsmen to shine in this exciting format. The significance of Raina's T20 century cannot be overstated, as it marked a new chapter in Indian cricket's journey in the shortest format.
