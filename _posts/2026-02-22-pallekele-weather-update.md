I'm happy to provide you with a 150-word post on the subject.

**Pallekele Weather Update:**

A low-pressure system is moving in, bringing with it a chance of scattered thunderstorms in the Pallekele region of Sri Lanka. The weather forecast indicates a high chance of rain on Saturday, which may impact the England vs Sri Lanka T20 World Cup Super 8 match in Kandy.

The match is scheduled to take place at the R.P. Super Club Ground, and fans are advised to check the weather forecast before heading to the stadium. The rain is expected to clear up by Sunday, providing a clear day for the match. However, it's still unclear whether the match will be played as scheduled, so fans should keep a close eye on the weather forecast.

Fans are advised to check the official Cricket Sri Lanka website for the latest updates on the match and weather conditions.
