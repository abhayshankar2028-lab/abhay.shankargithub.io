In a recent match, Ryan ten Doeschate expressed his sentiments in hindsight, stating that leaving out Axar Patel in the Super 8 match against South Africa was a "wrong decision." Ten Doeschate, who had scored a crucial 32 off 20 balls, was left out of the 11-man squad for the crucial encounter. The batsman's absence was attributed to a combination of factors, including the team's need for a lower-order batsman to finish the innings. "It was a wrong decision in hindsight," Ten Doeschate said. "Axar was playing extremely well and was a vital part of our team. We had a chance to bat for a full 50 overs, and Axar was playing for his country. It was a mistake, and we learned from it."
