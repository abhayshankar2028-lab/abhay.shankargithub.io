T20 World Cup | ‘In hindsight, it looked like the wrong decision’: Ryan ten Doeschate on leaving out Axar Patel in Super 8 match vs South Africa

In a recent interview, former West Indies cricketer Ryan ten Doeschate expressed his frustration over the decision to leave out Axar Patel from the T20 World Cup Super 8 match against South Africa. The move was seen as a strategic one, as Patel's experience and skills were deemed crucial to the team's success. However, Doeschate believes that it was a "mistake" to overlook the young and talented batsman. "In hindsight, it looked like the wrong decision. Axar was a game-changer, and he could have been the difference-maker in that game. We need players like him in our squad, and it's a lesson we need to learn from." Doeschate's sentiments underscore the importance of selecting the right mix of players for each match, especially in high-pressure situations like the T20 World Cup.
