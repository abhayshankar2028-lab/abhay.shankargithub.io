"T20 World Cup: In hindsight, it looked like the wrong decision" - Ryan ten Doeschate

In the Super 8 match vs South Africa, Axar Patel's omission from the playing XI to allow Shivnarine Chanderpaul to lead the batting lineup has sparked debate. As a former player and current TV commentator, ten Doeschate has weighed in on the matter. While Chanderpaul's leadership was instrumental in the victory, ten Doeschate believes that Patel's experience and ability to bat at No. 3 were crucial factors in the South African batting collapse. It was a calculated risk, and one that did not ultimately pay off. Ten Doeschate feels that allowing Chanderpaul to bat would have given the batsmen a better chance to recover and build a solid foundation.
