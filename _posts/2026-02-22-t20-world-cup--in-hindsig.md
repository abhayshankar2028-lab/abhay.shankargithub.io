**T20 World Cup | 'In hindsight, it looked like the wrong decision': Ryan ten Doeschate on leaving out Axar Patel**

In a recent Super 8 match against South Africa, former West Indies all-rounder Ryan ten Doeschate expressed his disappointment over not selecting Axar Patel in the starting XI. Patel, a key batsman for the Windies, was left out of the final 11, despite having a strong case for a spot. "In hindsight, it looked like the wrong decision," ten Doeschate said. "Axar was playing some fantastic cricket and was in form. He was the one who was pushing for a spot, and unfortunately, that didn't happen." Ten Doeschate felt that Patel's batting style, which often gets him out, was not considered due to his batting average being lower than some other options. The omission has sparked debate among cricket fans, with some arguing that Patel's form merited a spot.
