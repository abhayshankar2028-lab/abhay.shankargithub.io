Zimbabwe has made history in the T20 World Cup by beating West Indies in a thrilling match in Mumbai. The Zimbabwean side, led by captain Nicholas Hambirai, produced a stunning performance to overcome the West Indies' formidable firepower. After being bowled out for just 55 runs in 12 overs, Zimbabwe adapted their strategy and capitalized on the visitors' weakness to chase down the target.

Pacemakers Alvin Kalumah and Dane van Wyk played crucial roles in Zimbabwe's victory, with Kalumah scoring an unbeaten 36 off 22 balls. The West Indies' attack, featuring Jofra Archer and Alzarri Joseph, was also impressive, but ultimately fell short. Zimbabwe's fairytale performance has sent shockwaves through the cricket world, as they continue to defy odds and make a strong impression in the tournament. This win has set the stage for a battle of wits between Zimbabwe and Australia in the next match.
