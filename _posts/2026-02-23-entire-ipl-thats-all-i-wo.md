In a heartwarming yet insightful blog post, "Entire IPL, that's all I worked on," Dwayne Bravo shared how he played a pivotal role in shaping the art of slower deliveries for South African pacer Lungi Ngidi. As Ngidi's coach during his significant resurgence in the 2012 IPL, Bravo's influence was instrumental in refining the batsman's ability to handle slower pitches.

Ngidi, who struggled with batting on slower surfaces during his early IPL years, credited Bravo for teaching him the importance of footwork, arm speed, and body positioning. Bravo's guidance helped Ngidi develop a more efficient delivery, allowing him to post significant scores in the IPL. Bravo's contributions to Ngidi's success are a testament to the power of mentorship and the impact one person can have on another player's development, long after their IPL stint has come to an end.
