In a recent conversation with Cricket Australia, Dutch all-rounder Ryan ten Doeschate expressed his disappointment over the decision to leave out Axar Patel in the Super 8 match against South Africa. Ten Doeschate, who was not selected for the final game, reflected on the tournament and stated that he had initially believed that Patel's experience and expertise would be beneficial in the competition. "In hindsight, it looked like the wrong decision," he said. "Axar was a seasoned player who could have made a huge impact in the tournament. We knew that Axar had been working hard and was in great form, so it was a bit of a shock to not see him in the starting XI. We wish Axar all the best for the future."
