New Zealand's Daryl Mitchell is optimistic about the team's chances in the T20 World Cup after riding the wave of support in the ongoing international series against India. The Black Caps have been in top form, winning match after match, and Mitchell's impressive batting form has been a key factor in their success. With the Indian team's high expectations and the likes of Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja, the stage is set for a thrilling tournament. However, Mitchell remains focused on his team's task at hand and is determined to help New Zealand secure their place in the knockout stages. As they head into the T20 World Cup, the Kiwis are confident that their massive support base will give them the boost they need to overcome the challenges ahead.
