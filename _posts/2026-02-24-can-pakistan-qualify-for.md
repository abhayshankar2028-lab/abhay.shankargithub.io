Pakistan's T20 World Cup hopes took a significant hit after their 3-1 loss to England. To qualify for the semifinals, they need to secure a spot in the top two teams. Here are the key scenarios:

*   If Pakistan wins their remaining two T20Is against the West Indies and Bangladesh, they can secure a spot in the top two.
*   If they draw with the West Indies, they'll have a better chance of qualifying, but it would require them to beat Bangladesh in the final match.
*   If they lose both T20Is and get beat by Bangladesh, they'll be eliminated from the tournament.

To qualify, Pakistan would need to win at least one T20I against the West Indies to ensure they're in the top two.
