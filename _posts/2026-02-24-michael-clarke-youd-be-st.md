In a recent interview, former Australia captain Michael Clarke emphasized the importance of India's resurgence in the Cricket World Cup. While acknowledging that India's defeat to South Africa was a significant setback, Clarke stressed that the team's performance was not a reflection of their ability to compete with the best.

Clarke praised India's young talent, citing players like Rohit Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah as crucial contributors to their success. "You'd be stupid to write India off," he advised, highlighting the need for patience and continued development.

Clarke also emphasized the need for India to continue to invest in their cricket infrastructure, citing the importance of building a strong foundation for future success. With a renewed sense of optimism, India is set to play a crucial role in the World Cup, and Clarke's words serve as a timely reminder of the team's potential.
