Harry Brook, the England all-rounder, expressed his relief and hopes after the T20 World Cup. The tournament, which concluded in the UAE, ended with England securing their second title. Brook, who finished as England's leading run-scorer, stated that the experience was overwhelming but not daunting at all. "It's a massive finish, and I'm just glad I didn't have to play in another Oval," he said in an interview. Brook believes the T20 World Cup is a different format, allowing for more aggressive batting and death-over bowling. "We've learned a lot from this tournament, and we'll come back stronger," he added. Brook's performances in the tournament, including his triple century against Australia, were instrumental in England's success.
