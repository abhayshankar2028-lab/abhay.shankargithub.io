In a nail-biting finish, the T20 World Cup 2022 has come to an end, with England emerging as the champions. Harry Brook, the young all-rounder, described the experience as "mind-numbing". The team put up a remarkable display, with Brook scoring 89 off 66 balls, while also taking 2 wickets. Brook's performance was a testament to the team's collaborative spirit and skill. He was particularly proud of his batting and his ability to adapt to different conditions. Brook also praised his teammates, saying they were "the best bunch of lads in the world". Brook's victory is a sweet consolation for England, who were looking to lift the trophy after a long wait. The win was all the more satisfying given the high stakes and the tension that surrounded the tournament.
