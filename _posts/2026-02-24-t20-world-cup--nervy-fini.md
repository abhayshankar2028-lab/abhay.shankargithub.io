In a thrilling finale, England secured their first T20 World Cup title with a nail-biting victory over Australia. Harry Brook, the team's young opening batsman, played a crucial role in their triumph. In a nervous finish, Brook was instrumental in helping England post a total of 120/8, before Australia were bowled out for 119.

Brook's 44 not out in the final over was a showstopper, as he hit two crucial sixes and a boundary to seal the win. "I'm absolutely chuffed to have been a part of it," Brook said in the post-match interview. "It's a dream come true, but I'm still in shock. I hope it wasn't 'another Oval' – I was hoping to avoid that! (laughs) Seriously though, it's an incredible feeling knowing we've done it." Brook's heroics will go down in history as one of the greatest T20 titles in the tournament's rich history.
