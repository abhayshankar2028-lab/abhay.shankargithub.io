Bollywood blockbuster 'Love & War', directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, has seen its budget skyrocket to a staggering Rs 425 crores. Sources close to the production have revealed that the filmmakers have taken a huge risk by not charging upfront fees to the lead actors – Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, and Vicky Kaushal. The reason behind this bold move is to ensure that the film will generate substantial box office returns. Both Ranbir and Alia are newcomers, and their salaries will be a significant portion of the production costs. Meanwhile, Vicky, who has been with the project since the initial stages, will receive a hefty salary as well. The film's massive budget and star-studded cast make 'Love & War' a highly anticipated release in the coming months.
