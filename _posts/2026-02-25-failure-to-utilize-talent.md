Title: Why Pakistan's Loss to England is a Result of Poor Tactics Under Salman Ali Agha

The Pakistan cricket team's crushing defeat to England in the ICC World Cup has sparked outrage among former players, who are now slamming Salman Ali Agha's tactics. The team's failure to capitalize on the opportunities presented to them in the tournament has left fans and pundits alike scratching their heads. "It's a classic case of poor planning and execution," said former captain Misbah-ul-Haq. "You can't just sit back and wait for the game to happen, you need to take the initiative and dictate the terms of the game." Former all-rounder Shoaib Malik also echoed this sentiment, stating that Agha's team "didn't have the vision or the attacking depth to take on the best team in the world." It's clear that Pakistan's loss to England is a result of poor tactics under Agha's leadership.
