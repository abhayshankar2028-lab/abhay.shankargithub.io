New Zealand secured a thrilling victory in the ICC T20 World Cup, ending Sri Lanka's hopes of a final place in the tournament. The Kiwi team's fearless batting and bowling effort gave Sri Lanka a run for their money, as they were bowled out for a paltry 99 runs in 18.3 overs. New Zealand's captain, Kane Williamson, led the charge with a blistering 28 runs, while their bowlers, including Mitchell Santner and Trent Boult, chipped in with impressive performances. Sri Lanka's bowlers, however, struggled to contain the New Zealand batsmen, who posted a respectable total before eventually being bowled out. With this win, New Zealand has secured a spot in the final, where they will face off against a strong Australian team. This resounding victory marks a major milestone for New Zealand cricket, and will be remembered as a turning point in their journey to the top of the game.
