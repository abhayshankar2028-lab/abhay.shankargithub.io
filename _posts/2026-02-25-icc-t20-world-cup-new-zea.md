**ECB Sees New Zealand's Dominant Show in ICC T20 World Cup**

In a thrilling display of cricket, New Zealand has sent a powerful message to the rest of the tournament with a stunning 8-wicket victory over Sri Lanka at the ICC T20 World Cup. The Kiwi bowlers, led by a phenomenal display from Trent Boult and Mitchell Santner, tore into Sri Lanka's batting line-up with a combined 151 runs in 10.2 overs. After a spirited resistance from Sri Lanka, New Zealand's seamers ultimately proved too much to handle, dismissing the Lankies' top order with ease.

The win means that New Zealand has surpassed England as the top-ranked team in the tournament. The Kiwis' victory has set up a thrilling semi-finals showdown between their arch-rivals, Australia and South Africa. Will the pressure get to the Kiwis, or will they continue to defy expectations? Only time will tell.
