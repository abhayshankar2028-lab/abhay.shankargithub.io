In a recent statement, Taapsee Pannu sparked a controversy when she mentioned that focusing on female actors' 'cleavage or midriff' is an 'obsession' across the film industries. The actress, known for her bold expressions and strong roles, expressed her frustration with the constant emphasis on physical attributes in Bollywood movies. "I am tired of being objectified," Taapsee said. "Every time I walk down the street, people point and stare. It's like, I am a person, not just a physical appearance. It's time for a change." Her words reflect a growing sentiment among women in the industry, who feel suffocated by the relentless pursuit of physical perfection. It's a message that resonates with many, including Taapsee, who hopes to inspire a shift in the way women are portrayed on screen.
