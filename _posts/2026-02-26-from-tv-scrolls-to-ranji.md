**The Evolution of Jammu & Kashmir Cricket: From TV Scrolls to Ranji Finals**

Jammu & Kashmir cricket has come a long way since its inception in the 1930s. What was once a fledgling game in the foothills of the Himalayas has transformed into a fiercely competitive and respected domestic league. The journey began with humble beginnings, with cricket being introduced to the region by British colonialists. The first local league, the J&K Cricket Association, was formed in 1937. The league gained popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, with the establishment of the Indian Premier League's predecessor, the Inter-City Cricket League. The 1990s saw the rise of the Ranji Trophy, which has since become a benchmark for domestic cricket in India. Today, J&K cricket is a force to be reckoned with, boasting talented players and a passionate fan base.
