New Zealand's dominance prevails as they edge past Sri Lanka in the ICC T20 World Cup. The Black Caps' 8-wicket victory marks their third tournament triumph. In a thrilling match, New Zealand's bowlers controlled the proceedings, with Kane Williamson leading the attack. Sri Lanka's once-potent attack was dealt a blow when their star batsman, Dasun Chandrika, was bowled by Adam Zampiada. New Zealand's spin duo, Mitchell Santner and James Deacon, exploited Sri Lanka's weakness, while Trent Boult's late contribution sealed the deal. The final innings was all but done in the 15th over, with New Zealand reaching 136/5. Sri Lanka's 137/8 was a commendable effort, but ultimately fell short. This resounding victory cements New Zealand's status as one of the world's top T20 teams.
