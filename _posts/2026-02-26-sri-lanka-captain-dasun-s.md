In a recent interview, Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka has called for the government to take action to address the "negativity" surrounding the team after their disappointing exit from the T20 World Cup.

The Lankan side failed to make a deep run in the tournament, finishing last in the group stage. Shanaka has blamed the team's performance on the "negative" environment created by the media and fans, which has fueled his side's struggles.

Shanaka urged the government to intervene and provide the team with the necessary support to overcome the challenges they face. He also called for the media to be more responsible in their coverage of the team, highlighting the negative impact it has had on the players' morale.

The captain's appeal for help comes amidst a tense situation, with the Sri Lankan government facing criticism for not doing enough to support the team.
