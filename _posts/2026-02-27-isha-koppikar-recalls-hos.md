Isha Koppikar, a veteran Bollywood actress, recently shared a harrowing account of her hospitalisation experience after working non-stop for 5 days. "I'm lucky to be alive," she quipped, recalling her ordeal. "I was working round the clock, putting in 12-hour shifts, and barely had time to eat. The doctors were trying to save me, but I was running on fumes. It was like they were saying, 'Breathe, for once!' Bharti Singh, another renowned actress, chimed in, "We work until 15 minutes before we faint. It's like we're machines running on petrol, but our bodies are empty." Singh's words were laced with a sense of solidarity, reminding us that we're not alone in our demanding careers. It's time to take a step back, recharge, and remember the importance of self-care."
