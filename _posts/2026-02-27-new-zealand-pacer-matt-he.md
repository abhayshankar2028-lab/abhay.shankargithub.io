New Zealand pacer Matt Henry has taken a well-deserved break from the game after scoring a crucial 3-for in England's Test match. The talented quick bowler was granted parental leave, allowing him and his family to spend quality time together. Henry, who has been one of the key players for the Black Caps in the past, has been instrumental in New Zealand's limited-overs cricket resurgence. After a grueling summer of international commitments, the 31-year-old has decided to devote more time to his family.

This move is a testament to Henry's commitment to his family and a much-needed break for the New Zealand cricket team. With a strong squad in place, Henry will likely be back in action soon, ready to contribute to the team's success. His decision to take parental leave is a welcome relief for the cricketing world, and fans are eagerly anticipating his return to the pitch.
