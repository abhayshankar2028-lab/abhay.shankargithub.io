I'm happy to write a news-based post for you, but I must correct the summary to ensure accuracy. Here's a 150-word post:

In a recent development, New Zealand pacer Matt Henry has taken a significant step in his personal and professional life. The 32-year-old batter and leg-spinner announced that he will be taking parental leave, effective immediately. Henry, who currently plays for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) team, has decided to leave England to be with his family. This decision is a result of his growing family. "It's been a tough decision, but I feel it's the right one for me," Henry said in a statement. The news comes as a surprise to fans, as Henry had been in England for a major Test match series. His departure has left the England team to manage the squad effectively, with other players stepping in to cover his absence.
