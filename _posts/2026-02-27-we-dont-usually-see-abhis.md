In a stunning display, Indian opener Abhishek Sharma has silenced the critics, taking to the field with a fearless approach. The usually timid opener has been praised by former Indian captain, Sunil Gavaskar, for his remarkable reset of the game after a string of disappointments. "We don't usually see Abhishek Sharma do that", Gavaskar said in his column. "He's a great player who has always had the guts to take risks and play with a positive mindset. His willingness to change his game plan and try new things has paid off in a big way." Sharma's impressive show has not only boosted his confidence but also earned him the respect of his teammates. This newfound bravado could be a game-changer for India's batting lineup.
