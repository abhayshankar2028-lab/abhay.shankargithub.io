**Where will actors like me go?**

In an emotional and poignant interview, Bollywood veteran Adarsh Gourav shared his profound concern about the state of the industry. Speaking to us, he expressed his deepest fears about the future of small films in the current market. His words echo the struggles many talented actors face when their projects fail to break even.

Gourav's concerns are not unfounded. The number of small films produced every year seems to be on the rise. Many have been lost to the void, leaving behind only memories and unfulfilled dreams. The question on everyone's lips: where will these actors go? Will they be cast in bigger films, or will they be left to pursue their passions in obscurity? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain - the struggles of small films are real, and it's time for a change.
