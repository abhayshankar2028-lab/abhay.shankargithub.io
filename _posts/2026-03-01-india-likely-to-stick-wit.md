India is expected to stick with their unchanged XI for the upcoming T20 World Cup Super 8 clash against West Indies, despite concerns over the batting lineup's form. The team's coach, Roshan Pant, has refused to consider making any changes, citing the need for consistency and cohesion within the squad. The Indian side, led by captain Rohit Sharma, will look to build on their impressive form in the tournament so far. However, the West Indies, led by captain Jason Holder, have been in decent form as well, especially in the field. India will need to find a way to contain Holder and his skilled all-rounder, Jason Roy, while also addressing their own batting woes in order to secure a win. With the outcome of this match seeming uncertain, fans are eagerly waiting to see how India will navigate this challenge.
